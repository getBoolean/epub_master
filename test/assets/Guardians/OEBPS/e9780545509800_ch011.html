<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">That day, I returned to the hollow close to twixt time, and Lysa woke up.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Lyze, that you?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Of course. Why are you awake?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I’ve got this funny feeling in my tummy.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You do?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, ever since my First Meat last night.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You do!” I was terribly excited. I had arrived just in time with my chart. “Don’t panic, Lysa. Stay calm.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I am calm.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“This is nothing to worry about.” I took a big breath. “You are about to yarp your first pellet.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I thought it might be something like that. I think I’m budging, too. I just didn’t want to wake up Gundie.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“We’ll help you, dear,” Gilda said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Now here’s what we do,” I said. “I’m going to lead you to the very edge of the hollow. And you have to lean out and open your mouth very wide.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Lysa followed me to the portal and I helped her to the ledge just outside.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, my, it’s so beautiful! The snow looks pink.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It’s dawn snow, siypah schnee.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“This is so exciting. I’ve never been up this late. I’ve never seen the day!” She paused. “I’ve never seen the night for that matter. I’ve just heard about stars and the moon. Look, there’s one star left over from the night!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“That’s the Light Bringer, the morning star. The one that climbs into the dawn before the sun rises.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It’s lovely. I never thought there would be lovely things that were part of the day. I thought it was only the night that hatched beautiful treasures like stars and moonlight.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You won’t be able to see the Light Bringer for long. Not after the sun rises. But now you must concentrate on that pellet. How’s it coming?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, that!” she replied dismissively.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Not ‘oh, that!’ This is important. We’ll mark it on your chart. Come on now. This is your chance to show how grown up you are. Open your beak really wide,” I urged her.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Lysa opened her beak as wide as she could.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Now you’re ready to yarp,” I said. “Make a little hiccup. That’s it … that’s it. Go for it! It’s coming. I can hear it rumbling.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Something flew out of her mouth.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You did it!” I exclaimed.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Where’d it go?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Down there. A nice plump pellet. When you start to eat the meat on bones with fur, all your pellets will even be bigger.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, my Glaux, I might not be up to a really big pellet.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Of course you will.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Lysa looked down, trying to spot where the pellet had landed.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You want me to fetch it? We’ll show Gundesfyrr when she wakes up.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What a lovely idea!” Gilda said. “I’ll go down and get it.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I heard a flapping sound in the distance. <span class="italic">That’s rather loud</span>, I thought. A dread seeped through my gizzard. Lysa must have picked up on it.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What is it, Lyze?” she asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What is it?” a familiar voice hooted like a slightly distorted echo.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Oh, Glaux!</span> It was Tantya Hanja. I saw Gilda freeze in her tracks.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Go away!</span> I wanted to schreech. But she was our aunt.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, my goodness. What an adorable little owlet,” Hanja said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I just yarped my first pellet!” Lysa said. She tucked her wings behind her and swung her tail back and forth a bit, she was so proud.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, melt my gizzard!” cooed Tantya Hanja.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Gilda had climbed back up the tree with the pellet coiled in her tail.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Do come in,” she said politely, then gave me a rather sharp nudge with her head as if scolding me for forgetting my manners.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, do come in,” I repeated. “So — so … happy to see you,” I lied.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Any voles? White-footed mice?” she asked as we entered the hollow. “I love the voles from this woods. They’re very sweet.” Have I mentioned that Tantya Hanja was a bit of a mooch? She always traveled with a botkin and happily received any gifts that owls bestowed on her. And they bestowed many in an effort to get rid of her quickly.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No white-footed mice, but I’d be happy to get you some,” I said quickly.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Usually, when I went out hunting, I went bare-taloned. But I knew Tantya Hanja was an incredibly nosy old Screech. Always poking about the hollow under the guise of nest-keeping, as she had just begun to do.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, Gilda, I think you missed some inchworms in that corner,” she called.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I didn’t want her poking around my battle claws and discovering the caps that disguised the sharp tips. So I put them on.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Your training claws, Lyze! How handsome. You wear them for white mice? Hardly seems worth the effort.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I need all the practice I can get.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You’ll make a wonderful cadet. When do you go to the Academy?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Not soon enough</span>, I wanted to say. “Soffen issen,” I replied.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Spring? Well, that’s not too far off. This little one might be flying by then.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I hoped so. I couldn’t wait until Lysa could fly. In a very few weeks when the snow wasn’t too heavy in the trees, I planned to start her on branching.</p>
