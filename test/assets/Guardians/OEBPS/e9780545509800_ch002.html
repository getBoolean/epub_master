<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">The owlet years can be divided into three stages. The first is commonly called the Fuzzball stage, and the subsequent ones are the Fledgling and the Flight stages. They are often referred to as the Three Fs. The Fuzzball period is named after an owlet’s lack of true feathers. Instead, we are covered in unsightly patches of downy fluff. All adult owls think we are extremely cute, absolutely adorable. How quickly they forget! If you are an owl chick, you’re embarrassed about being half naked, and because you are half naked, you’re always cold and dependent on mature owls to cuddle and comfort you to keep you warm. Worst of all, you can’t fly! You examine yourself every five seconds for any trace of budging points, those tiny little knobs of flesh where feathers begin to poke through.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In the Fledgling stage, a chick begins to learn how to branch, which will ultimately lead to flying. Of course, in the Northern Kingdoms, there aren’t many trees, so branching per se is difficult. Instead, we have to use rocky, often ice-sheathed outcroppings. My family was lucky, for we lived in one of the few stands of trees on Stormfast Island. The hollow in which I hatched was in a slender pine.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">But I digress. It was long before I branched that I had my First Meat ceremony, and this was when I met my parents for the first time.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“They’re coming! They’re coming!” Gundesfyrr hooted.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Who’s coming?” I chirped.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Your mum, your da, back from the last battle near the Ice Talons, and just in time for your First Meat ceremony.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I get to eat meat!” I did a little jump. Meat was actually more exciting to me than my mum and da. Remember, I had never really seen a mum or a da. But I’d seen a lot of meat. Gundesfyrr and her friends were always chomping on rockmunks, a kind of chipmunk that lived in the rocky cliffs on Stormfast, or lemmings or voles. Sometimes they even ate fish. The Fish Owls dove for them off one point of the island. But all I ever got to eat during my Fuzzball stage, beyond the slime from my eggshell, were carefully selected insects. Insects don’t have meat and, most significantly, they don’t have blood. The scent of blood when Gundesfyrr and her friends came in with freshly slaughtered rodents was enough to drive me <span class="italic">yoickers</span>!<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn2" id="fn2"><span class="superscript">2</span></a> So I was beside myself when I heard that my parents were coming and bringing me a plump vole!</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The only problem was that when Mum and Da flew into the hollow, I nearly yarped. It wasn’t the vole with its steaming guts slithering out from the slash of my mum’s talons that made me want to yarp. It was Mum who gave me a fright. She only had one eye! Where the other eye should have been was a pit leaking blood through a seam that had been coarsely stitched across it.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Do all mums just have one eye?</span> I wondered. I couldn’t help myself, and I shrieked when she bent over me. Suddenly, I knew — this was the face of war!</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh dear, my patch must have slipped off,” my mum said. She quickly reached up with her port talon and pulled down a small piece of lemming fur to cover the eye pit. “I didn’t mean to scare you, Lyze. No, never! You are a dear little thing.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Gundesfyrr nudged me a bit, then whispered, “Greet your mum, dear.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, let him get used to me. I know it must be hard. I’m just glad I’ve got one eye left to see him with.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Hello, Mum. Sorry, I — I —” I was trembling. I just couldn’t look at her.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Never mind, dear. You’ll get used to it.” But would I? And what if I didn’t? Everyone was a warrior, a soldier. All anyone ever talked about was war. This was our life, why owlets often knew their hire broody and nest-maid snakes better than their own mums and das. I knew I would have to toughen up, so I dared myself to look at the horrible gash that ran out from under the lemming fur, like a jagged thunderbolt down her face. Did I doubt war at this point? I’m not sure. After all, I was just an owlet. But I might have doubted myself and whether I could be an honorable member of the Kielian League.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Rask was my father’s name. It was an old-soldier name and meant fast or quick. But he was not quick enough, apparently. One side of his face had been seared and he was missing his whiskers! Not a pretty sight. But not nearly as shocking somehow as my mum’s missing eye.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What a tough little owl we got here! A veritable <span class="italic">whiskerspritz</span>!” my father said. “<span class="italic">Whiskerspritz</span>” was a term of endearment for a young Whiskered Screech Owl. It meant “full of spirit.” I felt anything but, and truthfully I felt a bit cheated. My parents were legends on Stormfast, but heroes or not, one was missing an eye, and the other, half his whiskers. And then I realized that it was shameful for the son of heroes to be thinking this way.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Don’t let this bother you, son.” My da tapped the whiskerless side of his face.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Do you think they’ll grow back?” I asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Probably no more chance than your mum here has of growing another eye. But we showed them, didn’t we, Ulfa?” He turned and nuzzled my mum.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Where was the battle, sir?” Gundesfyrr asked quietly. Nay, not just quietly, but reverently. She looked straight into their mangled faces as if paying homage to their scars. <span class="italic">I must try and do the same</span>, I thought.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“First Ice Talon between there and the Ice Narrows. Just a skirmish, really. They got her eye and my whiskers, but we got them! By Glaux, we got ’em! We were the only ones in our units who were injured. Very lucky we were. Very lucky.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Lucky?</span> I thought. <span class="italic">They call this luck?</span> All I could think about was my mum’s eye — somewhere at the bottom of the Everwinter Sea. However, when they started to speak of the strategy and the weapons, I must admit it interested me. War seemed like a strange but violent puzzle to me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“We left our mark, didn’t we, Sweet Gizz?” My da nuzzled my mum’s chest feathers.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Darned hootin’! Your da raked off half a Great Horned’s beak, and I snapped off not one, but two, of the other fellow’s talons.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Mercy!” exclaimed Gundesfyrr. “And you having just lost your eye!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I know. Not sure how I did it. It’s one of those instances in battle when you don’t think, you just do. Something rushed through me like a hurricane-force wind and just … just propelled me. I didn’t feel any pain, any anger even, just a passion to destroy.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It’s called being a soldier,” my da said. “You’ll do it, too, someday. Someday, young’un!” He turned to me almost jubilantly, as if anticipating the courage I wasn’t sure I’d have.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I wondered if I would ever be a soldier, a true soldier.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“When can I have my meat? I’m hungry,” I said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“That’s the spirit, lad!” my father boomed.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, let’s get on with the First Meat ceremony!” My mum’s voice rang out joyfully.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Before I knew it, the hollow was crowded. For this ceremony, my mother stripped the fur from the vole, and then my father stripped the meat from the bone. It is more digestible this way for a young chick. We are not expected to swallow the creature whole, like the grown-ups do. Our gizzards aren’t up to it.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">Mum and Da were around for a good while, as they had been granted a long leave. And before I knew it, I had passed through my First-Fur-on-Meat ceremony, which meant I got to eat the entire vole skin off the bone but with the fur. The fur tickled when it went down. And finally, it was time for my First-Meat-on-Bones ceremony. For that, they always bring back quite a small rodent, either a baby or one of the dwarf rats that scramble about on the beaches of Stormfast. There’s a bit of a knack to eating a creature whole.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No, dear, headfirst. They slide down the gullet easier that way,” my mother counseled. Once I got the creature oriented right (I believe it was a dwarf rat), I took it down with one gulp followed by a very loud belch.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You sound like your old man, lad.” My da laughed, and gave a loud belch himself.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Honestly, Rask!” Mum sighed.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">And then, of course, it was time to sing the belching song that celebrates the first time an owlet eats his first whole animal with meat, fur, and bones. The song is called “The Uuul-glutch,” a word that looks almost unpronounceable here on the page and resembles the sound of a deep belch that can only be made by animals with gizzards. Owls essentially have two stomachs. The first is a stomach like that most animals have. The second is the gizzard, a thick-walled and very muscular stomach made for grinding up grit and packing in small bones and fur. <span class="italic">Uuul-glutch</span> is the sound made when something passes from the first stomach to the second one, the gizzard.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Gundesfyrr started the singing:</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">Uuul-glutch! Uuul-glutch!</p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">Let the sound ring out.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">There’s a little critter that</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">No longer scampers about.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">Lodged in the gizzard</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">Fast and cozy it does lay.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">And soon a pellet is on its way.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">And very soon it was. Mum and Da led me to the edge of the hollow and I yarped my first real pellet. I was growing up fast!</p>
