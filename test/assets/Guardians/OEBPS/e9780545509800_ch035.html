<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">We clawed up slowly, deliberately, and in total silence. We donned our helmets — a new piece of gear Thora had designed with airfoils on the sides to increase our speed. Each owl double-checked the locking mechanisms on his or her claws. Every step in getting ready was an opportunity to focus, to ensure we were completely ready and not vulnerable to careless mistakes. Clawing up was a ritual of intense concentration. The last piece of gear we put on before taking up our weapons were our ice goggles.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We wore a new goggle design that was vastly improved. The design was a collaborative effort between Orf, Thora, and two ice harvesters, Liefa and Friedl. I had brought back samples of what I thought was an unusual kind of blue ice from the Shagdah Snurl. This ice was much bluer than the ice we’d previously used for goggles. I was impressed with its clarity and when I held it up to the sun in the brightest part of the day, I noticed that it could filter out the most blinding rays. “Imagine,” I’d said, “if we could fashion protective eye covers from these. We could do raids in the day when the enemy is blinded — we could attack in the noonday sun.”<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn35" id="fn35"><span class="superscript">35</span></a></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We worked on the goggles for several moons and, in fact, our entire attack strategy was planned around the use of them. We were going to attack at dawn and flush Bylyric out into the blinding sun as it was rising over the horizon. It was essential that we press the advantage of the sun’s glare. When the enemy came out from the protection of the ice walls of the Talons, we would force them to face east, directly into the rising sun. If they turned tail and fled west, we would lose them. We had to cut off all their exits.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">For this operation, I wouldn’t be flying with Octavia. She was really too large for the narrow channels of the Ice Talons and wouldn’t be able to take full advantage of what we called the snakes’ “swing span.” So I was to carry a small but very effective snake named Albimore, a cerulean lazuli. Octavia would ride outside the Ice Shield aboard Rufus, our Spotted Owl navigator.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The silence was thick as we attached our goggles to our helmets. We would take off from Dark Fowl at night and wouldn’t pull down the goggles until dawn broke.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">As we lifted off, Loki looked at me, and I could tell he was thinking of those fire spikes from the Other that I had dropped into the Bitter Sea. Would they have made us feel safer than these goggles? Would the spikes have given us a deadly advantage? These were questions I wasn’t prepared to answer. Besides, the fire spikes were rusting at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">As we entered the narrow ice passage that led us toward Bylyric, I felt the onslaught of new strange winds. It felt as if we were caught in a latticework of gusts. Blix was flying wing command for one of the smaller units, called chaws. She was extraordinary. We followed her path as her tiny body shuttled through the warp and weft of the gusts. The other members of the chaw steadied as we mimicked her wing motions. We might not all be Saw-whets, but we were all now flying like Blix. In the narrow channel of water below us, I saw the mottled head of a snow leopard, swimming silently. <span class="italic">They’re with us!</span> I rejoiced.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">It was not yet dawn, but the light in the passages was growing brighter, bouncing off the slick ice walls. In another few minutes, it would be blinding to the uncovered eyes of an owl.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We swooped around a bend, backwinging madly as we caught sight of two guards. Astonishingly, they were sound asleep! Blix silently drew one of Thora’s new ice splinters and the action began. A startled guard gave a loud screech as the ice splinter pierced his shoulder. Two snow leopards sprang from the water with earsplitting screams. Enemy owls streamed out from their hollows in the ice walls.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We wheeled to begin our split maneuver. Blix looped back, skimming close to the water and underneath the enemy owls. A Pygmy Owl flew with her as a midair reloader. Blix let loose a barrage of ice splinters, pressing the Ice Talon owls east toward the rising sun.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">A Whiskered Screech had swerved out of the pack and flew directly at me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Grip One!” I cried to Albimore. He coiled up into a spring on my back, a posture that gave him immense power. We dove beneath the Screech and came straight up under him. Between my battle claws and Albimore’s fangs, we split him in two.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The other five owls in our unit, each of us with a Kielian on our back, raced ahead. The snakes swung their heads like flails, and no enemy could get near us. Albimore kept up a running report. I was dying to know if Bylyric had appeared yet. Was he one of the pursuers?</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Got a fully armed small Snowy off your starboard tail feathers,” Albimore called. “Must be his son.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Not Bylyric?” I felt my gizzard sink to my talons.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Watch out! There’s a butt-ugly Spotted Owl to port —”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Feathers streaked with blood swirled up beside me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Albimore! What’s that?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Albimore whooped. “Snow leopards took out a guard on the ice ridge.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We were approaching the main shaft. I could feel the suck of the wind on my wings. The air currents were immensely strong, as if we were being inhaled by some enormous creature. And then we were up and out, in the full-glare sun.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“There he is!” shrieked Albimore. And so it was! The Orphan Maker, Bylyric himself, was staggering through the blades of the rising sun. Bloodred crescents crisscrossed his facial disc, swiping over his beak and curling up beneath his eyes, which seemed to spin against the white feathers of his face. The design tilted at an odd angle and I felt myself tilting, too, as if I were hypnotized in some way. There must have been an escape hatch for Bylyric in a side notch of the ice maze. How else would he be flying here, away from the main action below?</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My eyes widened and, for a second, shock locked my wings. For flying by his side — <span class="italic">by his side!</span> — was Ifghar with Gragg riding high on his back.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">One thought filled my mind: <span class="italic">Separate them!</span> If I could separate Ifghar from Gragg, I could save him.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No, Lyze! No!” Albimore cried out to me as I started to bank, but I barely heard him. I was obsessed with tearing Gragg from the back of my brother.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What are you doing?” I screamed at Ifghar. He opened his beak and howled maniacally, then peeled off to port. Gragg hissed and swung his head toward me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">No! Don’t follow!</span> shrieked a voice in my head. Ifghar and Gragg were baiting me, distracting me. Gragg was riding my brother’s back like a succubus, a hagsfiend without wings, a witch.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I had just one thought: It was Gragg’s fault! Kill Gragg and I would get my brother back. I chased them, flying very low now, just skimming the white caps of the Ice Talon straits.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Go back! BYLYRIC!” Albimore’s voice finally scratched through my anger. I looked up and saw his head tossing frantically upward.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, great Glaux!” I yelled.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Lil was advancing on Bylyric with Miss Hot Point clutched in her starboard talon. He carried a fizgig in one talon and an ice dagger in the other. Strix Struma was flying a decoy pattern to keep Bylyric heading directly into the sun, which blasted over the eastern horizon like the fire from an immense and diabolical forge. Had it not been for the goggles, our eye tubes would have been fried. <span class="italic">They’ve got him!</span> I thought.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Then a wind came out of nowhere, a haggish wind that threw Lil and Strix Struma into a dangerous tilt. Lil had just raised her hot lance, and the weight pulled her into a roll. She careened wildly and lost her grip on the lance, which fell into the sea.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The haggish wind kicked Bylyric over sharply so that he was no longer facing the sun. He could see again, and he screeched and advanced on Lil. He had her in his sights! Through my goggles, I could see the bright fire of lunacy burning in his eyes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“LIL!” I shrieked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I winged upward like a streak. I could feel Albimore rising into a strike coil on my back, the winds whizzing by his fully extended fangs.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Then the world seemed to slow. I staggered in flight as I saw Ifghar appear once more. He was closing in on Lil as well, Gragg on his back, fangs glinting. It was an ambush! Ifghar hooted something to Lil that I couldn’t hear at first. Then a gust of wind snagged his cries and slammed the words into my ear slits.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“We’ll die together! I love you! I’ve always loved you!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I couldn’t believe it. Ifghar loved Lil? Ifghar was going to kill her?</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I shot up like a lava bomb from a volcano, my battle claws curved to rip my brother in two. But in my rage, I got too near to Gragg. Before I could do anything, I felt Gragg’s fangs reach out and tear at my eyes. I saw blood — my own blood. Suddenly, the haggish winds were drenched in red, more blood than could possibly come from me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">From the corner of my good eye, I caught sight of Lil, her golden eyes frozen in horror.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">There was an ice dagger deep in her chest, and she was spinning down and down in a slow spiral until a cresting wave below reached up and dragged her into the sea.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“NOOOO!” I screeched. It wasn’t supposed to be this way! It was supposed to be Ifghar, not Lil. Not my darling Lil!</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Yet through that blood I saw a clear path to Bylyric. I shot straight up to him. It was his ice dagger that had killed my Lil, and he only had one weapon now, the fizgig. He never saw me coming. I thrust my battle claws deep into him. Something dropped through the air, like a blood star out of the dawn.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“The gizzard! Bylyric’s gizzard!” came the cry. To strike the gizzard is truly one chance in a million. It’s so rare that it’s thought to be almost magical. The battle stalled. It’s as if I’d taken the gizzard of the whole Ice Talon army.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">But my own gizzard was shattered as well. With my good eye, I looked down at the sea below. Lil’s lovely face, eyes closed now, bobbed up once, then twice, then sank into the tumultuous water. The foam of the waves was pink with her blood.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I went kerplonken, plummeting toward my love.</p>
