<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">At least eight owls and a peregrine stormed out of the darkness. The snow leopards leaped into the air, their huge paws striking the night. A Hawk Owl plunged down in a kill spiral for Blix, but went kerplonken when it saw a snow leopard take to the air in a huge jump. The leopard missed its target, but the owl crashed into the ground and broke its neck.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The night turned into a maelstrom of violence. Feathers and blood swirled in the mounting wind gusts.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Lyze!” cried Loki. “The launcher!” He was loading up a spike.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">There was a strange spitting sound as it whizzed across the field. An owl plummeted to the ground, a burning spike in its breast. Loki let out a warrior’s whoop and immediately began to reload. A Hawk Owl was brought down by one of our Great Grays, but an enemy Eagle Owl was coming in fast on Moss, and Moss was already showing a streak of blood on his coverts. <span class="italic">His blood or the enemy’s?</span> I didn’t have time to think. I raised my launcher, and a spike sliced the night. The next thing I knew, the Eagle Owl, the largest of all owls, plunged through the sky and fell dead to the ground, a spike thrusting from his chest. I reloaded and shot again, another spike slicing through the air. A scream tore the night, so piercing and unearthly I thought the moon would crack and the stars would fall from the sky. I couldn’t see who I’d hit.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In only a matter of seconds, the skirmish was over. It had only lasted as long as the silver flash of a moonbeam darting through a cloud. I suppose you could say we’d won, but it didn’t feel like a victory. Moss, Blix, Loki, and I swept over the battlefield to see the fallen. One of our Great Grays was dead, and a snow leopard named Patches was severely wounded. A spike was hanging from her haunch and burning off her fur, the spike I had misfired. It was the snow leopard who’d screamed in that terrible, haunting way.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Moss swooped down, yanked the flaming spike from the leopard, and hurled it into a snowbank.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Blix had done training as a field medic, and she and Loki tried to stanch the bleeding.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I made my way over to the peregrine, who was still alive but not for long.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Glynnis!” I whispered, shocked. “I — I thought you were on our side.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">She was gasping for breath. Blood gurgled from her beak. “You thought wrong, dearie!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Never had a term of endearment sounded so nasty, the word a vicious sting in the night. “Your little secret is out,” she gasped.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What little secret?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“The snakes! The snow leop —” But the words died on her beak.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">What General Andricus had said came rushing back to me: <span class="italic">The success of this division depends not simply on training, however, but on secrecy and surprise. I cannot emphasize that enough. Secrecy and surprise!</span> My gizzard collapsed within me. Everything was for naught. All the training, all the inventions, the new ideas — for naught! Bylyric knew all our secret strategies. The Orphan Maker was going to win.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">While Blix and the others tended to the wounded, I went around the battlefield and retrieved every single fire spike. I flew directly out over the Bitter Sea and dropped them into the churning waters, along with the two launchers that Loki and I used. They were too dangerous. I felt in my gizzard that they were the first step to total annihilation. As the churlish seas parted to welcome the last spike, I wondered if this was why the Others had vanished. Had they fallen in love with weapons and assured their own destruction?</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I did not know. I am more of a scientist than a philosopher, and just then, my mind was clouded with thoughts of the invasion to come.</p>
