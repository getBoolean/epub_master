<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">When I got back to Dark Fowl, I found Lil on an empty training field practicing with Miss Hot Point. She was concentrating so hard that she didn’t see me at first. When I churred at her, she dropped her lance and wheeled around, streaking toward me. We wrapped our wings around each other as we slowly alighted on the ground. I emitted the mellow, warbling trill, and Lil replied with a low, whinnying call. For the first time, we dared to sing the prelude of the courtship song.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Yes, we were ready to become wingfast and, within hours of my return, the bryll branch had been fetched, for that was the traditional perch for a couple getting wed. We asked to have the ceremony in General Andricus’ hollow at headquarters. There was a crack in the hollow that was normally plugged with ice and rock, but the general cleared it carefully so we could see the Light Bringer, the morning star.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I had fetched Octavia, Blix, and Loki, and Lil had found Thora and Orf. The only missing owls were Strix Struma and my brother, Ifghar. I found Strix Struma perched on the very top of a silver fir, taking in the view of the training field. Her attention was focused on my brother.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“There you are!” I said. “I’ve been looking all over. For Ifghar, too — I’m so excited!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, Lyze!” she said. “I’m happy you’re back safe and sound. About Ifghar — that snake friend of his —”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Not now! As a matter of fact I have to fly down there and fetch —”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Lyze!” she interrupted firmly. “It’s about Ifghar and his training. We should split up your brother and that snake Gragg.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I frowned at her. This was my wingfast day, and I didn’t want to be bothered with minor training problems.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Fine!” I said. “Split them up. But now, please let me talk! I’m here to invite you to Lil and my wingfast ceremony!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Strix Struma blinked. “That’s wonderful.” She gave Ifghar a nervous glance. I could tell that there was something disturbing her, but I didn’t have time to worry about it then. It was my wingfast day!</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">Lil and I took our places on the bryll branch. Thora had found some ice flowers and made a garland for Lil that draped down from the crown of her head to her lovely tawny shoulders. The tiniest issen blossoms and astrilla blume fell around her like a cascade of pale pink stars. Her talons were bare — neither of us wore battle claws. I realized it was the first time in forever that I’d seen her talons. She had cleaned them with balsam fronds, and they glistened pearly white.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Just before the final guest arrived, I heard a scuffle outside the hollow. After talking to Strix Struma, I’d been late, so I’d asked one of the general’s aides to fetch my brother. It became obvious that he wasn’t aware of the nature of the occasion. I could hear his voice rising in anger outside the hollow.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Well, Sergeant Luka Strix Varia, I do not see why Cadet Gragg, who is training with the Glauxspeed Division as a second-degree Kielian copilot, cannot be included in this meeting with the general. We are both exactly the same rank as cadets and —”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I have my orders, Cadet Ifghar Megascops,” said the sergeant.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Your orders!” grumbled Ifghar.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Strix Struma’s voice broke in crisply. “None of that, Ifghar! And don’t hiss at me, Gragg! I’m your commanding officer.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Thank you, madame,” said the sergeant.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Is Lil here already?” Struma asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes,” the sergeant replied, a slight smile in his voice. “She’s inside.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It’s a veritable party,” sneered Gragg.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It is a party, of sorts,” said Strix Struma. “It’s a wingfast ceremony.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“A wingfast ceremony?” I could hear Ifghar gulp. “Whose?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Who do you think?” I heard the sergeant say. “Your brother and Lil.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Ifghar looked numb as he entered the hollow. Except for one odd, almost stricken glance at Lil, his eyes were as hard as stones. But I didn’t let it distract me. This was our day, mine and Lil’s. The light of the morning star poured down through the crack in the hollow and wrapped us in its soft glow.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">General Andricus Tyto Alba began to speak. “Cadets, officers of the Kielian League, blacksmiths — friends of Lyze and Lil, we gather here at twixt time under the Light Bringer to sanctify and bless the union of these two owls, Major General Lyze Megascops Trichopsis, commander of the Glauxspeed Division, and Battalion Commander Lillium Megascops Trichopsis.” He turned to me. “Under the wings of Glaux and the eyes of the stars, do you, Lyze, take Lillium …”</p>
