<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">“What? What are you saying?” I asked Thora as she shook me awake.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Moss heard her and began to rouse himself.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It’s high noon, for Glaux’s sake! What are you doing up at this hour? Have you been drinking the bingle or something?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No! No! Come out of the barracks. I have to tell you something — privately!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Grumbling, Moss and I followed Thora outside. “What is it?” Moss said grouchily. This was one owl who did not like to be wakened.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Orf — they’ve owl-knapped him,” she said quietly. Our beaks dropped open.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">There was dead silence.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“We’ve got to tell someone,” I said. “We better alert the regimental commander.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No!” Thora said sharply.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Why not?” Moss asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“There were three other owls, Eagle Owls like the ones who took him, circling around the Academy headquarters and the parliament hollow — well-camouflaged, since the weather stinks.” She tipped her head up at the dark thunderheads hammering across the sky. Hag clouds, we called them. Lightning forked from them like the gnarled talons of a hagsfiend. Seagulls clattered into the sky, seeking refuge from the tumultuous sea.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“They know,” Thora continued with her head tipped toward the sky. “The owls know that when it’s discovered that Orf is missing, an all-out search will be launched. A squadron.” Thora looked at me. “Those Eagle Owls over the parliament will report it immediately.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“A squadron isn’t right for this. It’s too unwieldly,” I said. In my short time at the Academy, I had learned a thing or two. The one thing that the Academy lacked — indeed, the whole Kielian League lacked — were units with what I thought of as extreme maneuverability. We were fighting an old war, a century-long war, with old tactics. We needed new strategies and we needed them fast — like now! If just a few of us went, we could slip in unnoticed, as a squadron never could.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Thora nodded at us. “Then let’s claw up.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Lil — we need her,” I said. “There is nobody better with a hot lance than Lil.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">They knew I was right. Lil had become a fantastic lancer. It was as if Lil was out to prove to Lud-Dud that she was no missy when it came to fighting. She had exhibited such skills that she had won the coveted retractable hot lance in the full-shine games that were held when the moon was at its brightest.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“She’ll bring Miss Hot Point!” Moss exclaimed. They had all been shocked when Lil had given her hot lance this odd nickname. Lil had a wicked sense of humor, and it was her way of getting back at Lud-Dud and showing him just what a Miss Cadet could do with the right weapon in her talons.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">The owls who had nabbed Orf had taken him to Elsemere Island, an exceedingly clever move because it was the home of the Glauxian Sisters, a nonviolent meditative order that had taken vows of silence. The one exception to their rule of silence was in treating the sick or wounded. Then they could speak. They were renowned for their skills in the healing arts. The sisters were so peaceful that they didn’t hunt. They existed on little more than kelp and any creatures caught in the seaweed. Snails and bivalves such as clams or oysters were fine for them, for they had no blood.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Thora said the Eagle Owls and Skellig had taken Orf to the cliffs on the opposite side of the island from where the sisters lived, about as far from their retreat as possible. And even if the sisters had known that the Ice Talon operatives had nabbed the greatest blacksmith in the Northern Kingdoms, what would they have been able to say? The sisters didn’t believe in war or weapons. They had stayed neutral throughout the hundred-year history of this war and welcomed all owls to their infirmary for treatment, no matter what side they were on.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Our fear was that Elsemere Island was an interim stop for the treacherous owls. They would undoubtedly move on, skirting the northernmost coast of the Southern Kingdoms, and then head straight for the heart of Ice Talons League territory.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">As we approached the island, Lil turned to me. Her eyes glowed such a bright gold in the full sun of the day that I felt a shiver pass through my gizzard. Was this love? I couldn’t think of such things now.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You realize what’s at stake here?” Lil began. “If we fail, we’ll all be de-commed and thrown out of the Academy, but more important, the war will be over. The Ice Talons League will win. They’re already stronger than we are, and with Orf they’ll have all the best weapons, too.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I knew this, and I had but one thought: <span class="italic">We cannot fail!</span></p>
