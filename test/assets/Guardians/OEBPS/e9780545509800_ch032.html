<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">A few weeks after Ifghar’s trial, General Andricus sent me away with Loki to deliver a message to one of his lieutenants. Normally, he would have used a messenger falcon, but he understood I needed to get away from the Academy. Ifghar’s behavior had left me badly shaken.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The mission took us over one of the Kielian League’s refugee camps. Hundreds of owls had been left hollow-less or orphaned in recent moons. Often their parents were off fighting and their caregivers — their broodies or elderly aunts and uncles — had lost their lives. The attack that Moss and I had endured on Stormfast had been unusual at the time, but the Ice Talon League had begun attacking peaceful communities as a regular war tactic. This particular refugee camp was at the southern edge of the H’rathghar glacier.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We are prone to think of glaciers as endless expanses of featureless ice. But as the glaciers approach lower altitudes, small forests can spring up along their edges. This settlement camp, called Lav Issen, which means “low ice” in Krakish, was full of young owls. As we flew over the camp, we saw that all the available hollows were crammed, and owls were even huddling in old, rotten stumps. A small contingent of Kielian snakes was working its way through the camp, pulverizing the centers of stumps to create makeshift nests, and another group of owls and snakes were dragging in rotten logs to be used as well.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">No sooner had we alighted than I caught sight of the soft purple hues of a striated violusian.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Gilda!” I exclaimed. She had just slammed her head into a tree stump, and she blinked when she heard her name.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Lyze! Dear Lyze! And Loki!” She coiled up, tears glittered in her violet eyes. “Oh, my goodness! You’re here!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">She slithered over to me and began to loop herself loosely around my shoulders.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You aren’t out flying with … with …” I momentarily forgot the name of the Snowy she copiloted for.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Jonor,” she said. “He died. He took a fizgig to the skull in a skirmish off the Firth.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My gizzard seized. “How did you survive?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I fell into the ocean, and remember, we can swim.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“So what are you doing here?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Waiting for my next assignment. I didn’t want to just coil up and do nothing. They need all the help they can get in these camps. Look around you at all these orphans. This is the price we pay! The price of war!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">She paused. “You know, dear lad, I was never the best nest-maid snake. I wasn’t particularly good at keeping hollow, but I do rather enjoy smashing things up.” She whacked the rotten stump and peered into the cavity she had formed. “This is a nice cozy space — big enough for at least four Pygmies and a couple of Elf Owls. I left a bit of an overhang so the blacksmiths can make a metal piece to serve as a roof.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Very nice, Gilda,” Loki said.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">We hadn’t flown far when Loki cried out.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Mum!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Loki!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I couldn’t believe it. There was Wynnifryd, tending a fire with three voles roasting on it.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Mum, what are you doing here?” Loki and Wynnifryd wrapped their huge wings around each other, their faces radiating pure joy.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What am I doing here, son? My bit. My bit.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“But your wing?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I can fly — a tad cattywampus, but I got here,” she churred.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“B-b-but — what are you doing here?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What does it look like? I’m taking care of these young’uns and introducing them to the delights of cooked food.” When we perched on the log, I hadn’t noticed half a dozen little owlets upwind of her. She turned to them now.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“All right, little ones. Want to sing the song I taught you?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, Wynnie!” they cried.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">She took up the forked twig with which she had been turning the voles.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Now, a-one and a-two and a-three …” Six little peeping voices began to sing:</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">There’re voles in holes</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">And voles on coals.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">Yummy, yummy in my tummy!</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">All so nice and warm,</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">Warms you once,</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">Warms you twice.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">Roasted voles</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">Are awfully nice.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Nicely done! Now eat your voles while I take our visitors around the camp.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Wynnifryd took us on a tour. The first thing I noticed was the unnatural silence that enveloped the camp. Normally, when a bunch of owlets get together, there’s a constant racket of noisy chatter — gazooling, the elders call it. And owlets are always playing.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">No one was playing here. Very few were even flying. It was obvious that many had been orphaned before they had fledged, and there weren’t enough adults to begin them on branching. Many of the owlets looked so thin and tattered that I had to wonder if they’d even have the strength to branch. The fledged owlets had feathers that were so sticky with burrs and debris, it was doubtful they’d ever felt the gentle preening strokes of a cleaning beak.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">A little Spotted Owl who had just begun to budge was perched on a stump, crying. A Snowy tried to comfort him.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I know I’m not your mum. But I can keep you warm, and why not try to eat this bit of mouse? I took the fur off for you. Come on now, take a little bite.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“But I’m not hungry!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Wynnifryd leaned over and whispered in my ear. “Some of them are too weak to eat. That’s why I cook their food. It’s easier to get down.” She turned to Loki. “Fly back to my griddle and get that last vole. We’ll bring it to this little one and try him on it.”</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">It was heartbreaking. Later that same afternoon at tweener, we perched in a large hollow with Wynnifryd and the camp director, a Lieutenant Lyngaard Strix Varia.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“We’re not as flooded with orphans as some of the other camps. It’s tragic,” he said. I could not help but remember the dreadful night when Lysa died. If she had lived, would she be in a camp like this? Would I have ever been able to find her?</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The lieutenant swiveled his head toward me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I suppose you have heard, Lyze, that your brother has been recommissioned?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What?” I was stunned. “So soon? Why?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“We desperately need soldiers. I hate to say it, but we can’t be picky. No offense.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“None taken. My brother has been the offense. I hope he redeems himself on the battlefield.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“May Glaux guide him.”</p>
