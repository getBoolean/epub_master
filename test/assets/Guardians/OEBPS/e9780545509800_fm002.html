<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">Tonight something odd happened. A young Barn Owl and three of his companions showed up here. Blown right out of a force-eight gale. A raging thing it was, that gale, full of slop and ice. Couldn’t see for racdrops out there. These four had been traveling together for some time. They call themselves the Band, or a Band, as if they’re special or something. Perhaps they are. It’s the Barn Owl, the one called Soren, who interests me. There’s something about him that took me back to my own youth. It stirred me deeply.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">So I decided to put aside this book I’ve been working on, the third volume in <span class="italic">Weather Systems and Their Structure: How to Fly Them, Analyze Them, and Survive Them</span>, and turn instead to something a little less academic, a little less dry. Indeed, a story drenched with blood from endless wars and also tears, both happy and sad, of love, betrayal, and of hope.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The Barn Owl’s just a lad and does not know what he’s in for. I certainly didn’t. Oh my, I was such an innocent — if one can call an aspiring warrior “innocent.” And what am I now but a reclusive scholar, a scientist in a world still boiling with violence. I have chosen a different path. However, once I was a very different owl. So different.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Now I begin my own story. I shall call it simply <span class="italic">The Book of Ezylryb</span>.</p>
