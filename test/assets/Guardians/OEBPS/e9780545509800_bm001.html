<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">And so I have been a ryb at this grand old tree for decades. Now a young Barn Owl has arrived with his three friends. I can tell he will make a great leader, possibly even become a king of this great tree. You blink? Of course you do, for it’s a preposterous notion. To become king of the great tree, one must be born to royalty or “embered” as decreed by the prophecy of Hoole. Ridiculous, you say. But I say destiny has nothing to do with it. Only inner nobility and intelligence are what count in the end.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">So, dear reader, would you care to make a wager on my friend Soren? For I see genius where others might not.</p>
