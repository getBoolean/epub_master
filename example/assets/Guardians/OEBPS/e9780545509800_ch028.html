<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">We emerged from the ice tunnel into the harsh light of the Nacht Sted ice field glaring under a full-shine moon. The long shadows of the four-legged creatures slanted across the ice, and the wings of a Snowy threw great shadows against the silver disk of the moon.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Good Glaux!” Blix cried. “Moss!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">This was Moss’s secret training ground. Of course! What could be more secret than this desolate place? Had General Andricus known this when he granted my request to visit? I doubted it. Moss had been charged with finding a secret place, not ordered to go to one already specified.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">It was mesmerizing to watch the big cats stalk across the ice. Their walk was a silken motion, sinuous and silent. I couldn’t hear their paws touch the ground; they were as silent in their stride as owls are in flight. Beneath their marbled pelts lurked an unimaginable power. Their long tails swayed back and forth languorously, but I dreaded what the lash of their tails could do. Yes, these creatures were built to kill.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Look, he’s found his big owls, too,” Loki whispered. “Two Great Grays and two Great Horneds and an Eagle Owl.” Moss hadn’t mentioned finding any owls in his coded messages. We had worried that his outpost was too remote, and we couldn’t recruit.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We were about to call out to Moss when Blix noticed something. “How bizarre!” she said. “One of the Great Horneds is missing half a beak.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My parents’ words from an evening long, long ago came back to me: <span class="italic">We left our mark, didn’t we, Sweet Gizz? Darned hootin’! Your da raked off half the Great Horned’s beak, and I snapped off not one, but two, of the other fellow’s talons.</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The owls that had mutilated and nearly killed my mother were there in the moonlight, helping Moss train the snow leopards!</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Half Beak!” Moss cried out from the distance. “Guide them from the rear into the first defense configuration.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Wait!” I hissed at Blix. “Don’t say a word.” The Great Horned was a slipgizzle. Moss must have inadvertently recruited slipgizzles! I wilfed to half my normal size, and both Blix and Loki looked at me in alarm.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Whatever is it?” Blix said in a tiny whisper. Her words fell as quiet as snowflakes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“That’s the owl that attacked my mum!” My voice was trembling. “And that one flying just above the lead snow leopard’s head, that’s another one!” For indeed, the other owl was missing talons. “They’re slipgizzles working for the Ice Talons.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What?” Loki and Blix looked at me, stunned.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Slipgizzles!” I repeated. “Think about it. It would be easy for an owl to slip in around here, pass themselves off as wounded hireclaws, not able to go into the field but ready to help in training. Moss was up against time. He didn’t have the luxury to check out every owl.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What are we going to do?” Blix asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I flapped my wings in agitation. “I’m not sure. They’re big, powerful owls, and all we have going for us is surprise.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I saw Loki glance down at the launcher in his talons, and my gizzard twisted.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Suddenly, an idea came to me. <span class="italic">Code!</span> Moss was a master of all the Kielian League codes. He was especially good with the hardest of them all — the spoken code.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Our plan was a simple one. Blix was to do the speaking while Loki and I sequestered ourselves behind a large, ice-sheathed boulder.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We held our breath as Blix flew out.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Blix!” Moss cried out.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Verschtucken mitgon vouykinn schnitzkin bynnghis yonkus!” cried Blix. The spoken code is Krakish, but with double-meaning words. What Blix said in Krakish was “Hello, rockmunks are among us. My friends, the two Horneds.” But it meant: “Beware, slipgizzles are among us. The enemies, the two Horneds.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">From our vantage point, we could see that Moss was about to wilf, but he fought it hard. The two Great Grays were looking stunned, as well the Eagle Owl. They obviously understood the coded language, but the two Great Horned Owls did not, nor did the snow leopards. Except for this first small slip, Moss was doing a fantastic job of concealing his shock. The Snowy, my friend from earliest childhood, stayed as cool as any battle veteran.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In the spoken code, Blix told Moss where we were hiding. We could not hear the entire conversation for the wind was up again, drowning out many of the words. But it appeared that Moss called a halt to training for the night, though dawn — or the virtual dawn — was still some hours away, and then set up a guard rotation for the night.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It’s all right,” Loki whispered to me. “We outnumber them.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“They’re twice our size! And they could call in other owls, other enemy troops. There could be other Ice Talon owls holed up all over this place. Remember that peregrine your mum mentioned flying around? We could be outnumbered.”</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">From our sequestered perch, we could see that every creature, both owls and snow leopards, were extremely nervous that evening and ready for anything but sleep. Blix pretended to sleep in a small notch in some rocks. As dawn neared, I spied Half Beak rouse himself, swivel his head about slowly as if checking that his companions were asleep, and loft into flight. He flew straight out toward the Bitter Sea, quite far out, and when he returned, he wasn’t alone.</p>
