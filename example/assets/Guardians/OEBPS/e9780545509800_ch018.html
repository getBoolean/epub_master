<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">Did we return to glory? Not precisely, for even though we had rescued Orf, our methods were looked upon as dubious. The air was thick with the suspicions of the old-timers like Lud-Dud and his friends. An Elf Owl, Colonel Stellan Micrathene Whitneyi, the instructor of the B unit of the Frost Beaks, was outraged that Blix took not one, but: “Five! Count them, Blix, five ice splinters!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“But I only used three, Colonel Stellan Micrathene Whitneyi. And those hit their mark. One even got heart’s blood.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I don’t give a bloody racdrop about heart’s blood,” she ranted. “You took ice splinters from the armory without using the proper sign-out procedure. And I’m not even sure how you carried them all.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh! Colonel, I can explain that,” I offered.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Shut up, Cadet Lyze Megascops!” Lud-Dud thundered.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">If Orf had been there, he would have jumped to our defense. But he had been hustled off to high command for a debriefing. So we were subjected to a scorching reprimand. Our rescue of Orf took a back wing to the innumerable rules we had violated, which our superiors were only too willing to trot out one by one, ad yarpium.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Number one,” Optimus Strix Varia, the regimental commander, began, “you were all absent without leave. AWOL!” he roared. “Number two, you initiated a combat mission without consulting your commanding officer. Number three …”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">On and on he went. I was dying to interrupt and say, “Number four, we got Orf back, you idiotic old fogies!” I wanted to explain how brilliant Blix and Loki had been. I wanted to describe the midair reload. I wanted to tell them Thora’s idea for a new kind of quiver to make reloading even easier.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Orf returned from his debriefing and listened carefully and with obvious surprise to the sharp criticism we were taking. By this time, the regimental commander had almost exhausted his venomous lecture and was becoming slightly more conciliatory. “Well, Cadets, I hope you have learned your lesson,” Optimus Strix Varia sighed wearily.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Lesson! What lesson?” Orf growled. “We are the ones who need to learn some lessons here. What these young’uns did out there was nothing short of brilliant. I’ve just cleared it with the speaker of the parliament, General Andricus Tyto Alba. Cadet Thora is no longer to be in training as a combat cadet.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I told you so,” snickered Colonel Stellan Micrathene Whitneyi. “They’re de-comming her.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I heard that, Colonel,” Orf roared. “Nothing of the sort! Thora is to serve as a cadet apprentice to me.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“A female blacksmith?” A murmur rose among the commanding officers.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Insane,” someone whispered.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Strains credulity,” Lud-Dud hissed.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Don’t strain that wee brain of yours too hard, Captain Ludvigsen Asio Flammeus. We wouldn’t want a cranial rupture,” Orf muttered. Flapping his wings noisily, he turned to Thora and said, “Follow me, Cadet Apprentice Thora Nyctea Scandiaca.” This was somewhat extraordinary. Orf had just addressed Thora by her full species name, a sign of the highest respect. A silence fell in the hollow. Colonel Stellan and the others seemed to wilf and meekly parted way as the blacksmith marched through the crowd. Thora herself seemed stunned.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Orf glared at Lud-Dud and Stellan and the others as he passed, but he smiled when he stopped in front of me. “Lyze.” He nodded, turning to Lil, Blix, and Loki as well. “General Andricus wishes to meet with you. Thora, you too. All five of you follow me.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I thought I heard a snicker from Lud-Dud, as if to hint that finally we were to get our comeuppance. I have to admit I thought the same, and as we entered the general’s hollow, my gizzard was aquiver.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">General Andricus Tyto Alba was a strikingly handsome owl except for a scar that ran down his breast. It was said an ice splinter had come within inches of his heart in a battle in the high H’rath, years before. He had fought on fiercely, though blood had poured from his chest. The general was quite large for a Barn Owl and some said had the strength of an Eagle Owl, the largest of all owls. Stern, uncompromising, he was not one to suffer fools or cowards.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">His back was toward us as we entered, but he wheeled about. The scar blazed across his chest in a diagonal slash. It was shocking to look at, and I couldn’t help but wonder how the attack had missed his heart. How he could have survived such a wound?</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“And what do you cadets plan to do for your summer holidays?” the general asked. “You certainly deserve a holiday!” I could feel everyone’s relief. We were not going to be punished.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Thora and I hope to go to the Shagdah Snurl with Blix and Loki, sir,” I replied.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I’m not sure what I plan to do,” Moss answered.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, great Glaux, I nearly forgot!” The general swiveled his head toward me. “Cadet Lyze Megascops, a message for you was delivered by your aunt Hanja. She says that you are expected home. A new home, as I understand your family hollow was destroyed. Let’s see … Sergeant Alion Tyto Castanops?” he called out. The general’s secretary, a Masked Owl, came forward.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, sir.” The sergeant saluted crisply.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Do you have the note left by his aunt?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Right here, sir.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Let me see it.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The general took out a pair of issen blauen spectacles. Thinner than the combat goggles, they magnified his eyes enormously as he began to read the piece of birch bark. “Says here that your family has relocated to a hollow on the northern side of Stormfast — up an inlet in a grove of spruce trees. They expect you home for … oh, my goodness! A blessed event — your mum seems to have laid an egg, and they will be in residence most of the summer.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh,” I said quietly.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What marvelous news!” the general boomed.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes,” I replied in a subdued voice. But in truth I was rather disappointed. I hadn’t really finished grieving for Lysa. How could Lysa be replaced so easily? I supposed that’s how it was in the owl world, especially when we had been at war for a century. We were always told we must forge on. If a parent died, the remaining mate usually found a new partner quickly. It was simply our way. We had to move forward.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">But I was not quite ready to forge on. And I really wanted to go to the Shagdah Snurl with Blix, Loki, and Thora. I wanted to see how the winds hatched. I wanted to feel their furl as they were birthed out in the coldest place on Earth by the hot tentacles that snaked out from the volcano and its lava lake in the mysterious Nacht Sted. I wanted to see that lake where rock melted. It was a place of legend, but I knew legends were born from unrevealed truths. Legends tell stories about forces we sometimes cannot understand but are part of the fabric of our lives. I so wanted to go, but it was not to be.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">As I was leaving, the general stopped me. “Wait a minute, lad. I have a question for you.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, sir?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Orf told me that you have some notions, some ideas about … well … how should I put it? Newfangled ways of fighting. You did pretty well out there at Elsemere. Apparently, this midair reload was something to behold.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I had mentioned the idea to Blix and Loki, sir, but they really figured it out. They should get the credit.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“When you return, I’d be most pleased if you would come visit me again and share any other ideas you might have.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Really, sir?” I squeaked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, really.” He opened his eyes wide and blinked behind the issen blauen spectacles. “Want to give me a hint as to one or two of those ideas now?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My heart raced, my gizzard quickened. This was a rare opportunity. The instructors at the Academy never listened to cadets. How could I forget Captain Lud-Dud’s accusations that I was being too fanciful? And now that was just what the general was asking me to be. Within the space of a minute, my existence, my life, took on new meaning.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Sir, have you ever thought of including Kielian snakes in a combat unit?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Kielian snakes?” He shoved his head forward and removed his spectacles. “Great Glaux, no! It rather boggles the mind.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Not mine,” I replied. “I think they’re underutilized.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The general considered. “Come up with a plan and I’ll hear you out.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Absolutely, sir.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I have to admit that my spirits were lifted considerably. The prospect of going home and not to the Shagdah Snurl was less grim. Now my main concern was how much I would miss Lil. I already had an ache in my heart and a soreness in my gizzard. My first season at the Kielian Military Academy had drawn to a close. I would return when the first snows of liffen schmoo began to fall and, by the following spring, I would be a commissioned officer in the Allied Forces of the Kielian League.</p>
