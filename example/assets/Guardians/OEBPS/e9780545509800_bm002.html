<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">As so often happens, I have been inspired by other artists, and I wish to acknowledge and give credit where credit is due. In Chapter 8 when Tantya Hanja bursts into song at the grog tree, the song she sings was completely inspired by Bob Dylan’s “The Times They Are A-Changin’,” a ballad written at the height of the Vietnam War whose lyrics went beyond the war to address social and racial issues. The names for the different kinds of snow were taken — although not exactly — from an Inuit lexicon that describes more kinds of snow than I could have ever imagined. The myschgrad serpent that the blink skog of Dark Fowl tells a story about is based on the legendary Midgard serpent of the Norse sagas.</p>
