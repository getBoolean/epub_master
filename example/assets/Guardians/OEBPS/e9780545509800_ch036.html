<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">This is what’s so terrible about grief: You relive the final moments of your beloved’s life for years and years and years. It’s like flying with one wing. You never become used to it. The shock might wear off, the images grow a little dimmer. But the panic creeps back while you sleep in the brightest part of the day. My dreams are drenched now with the pink foam of the cresting waves, waves pink with the blood of my Lil. The same pink as the ice flowers she had worn on our wingfast night, the pink of the garland she had draped over her head. I have a deep and abiding hatred of morning light now, of high noon, of anything that reminds me of the day my mate died.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">I went kerplonken during the battle and when I regained consciousness, I found myself in a vacuum transport. A voice murmured to me in comforting tones, trying to reassure me. But what could anyone say? Lil was dead. I’d watched the Everwinter Sea swallow her lacerated body. And with it, the future had died, been snuffed out — the very future of which she had spoken about so boldly to me. It was as if a knife had cut through the lovely darkness of dreams to reveal a horrible and eternal brightness that was to be my future.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We owls are creatures of the night, companions of darkness. Our dreams blossom in darkness, and in the light, they wither and die.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The voice beside me in the transport vacuum kept speaking in soothing tones. It took me a while to realize that it was Octavia. I gasped as I saw her head. It was so small, so damaged. And what was wrong with her face? Then I realized it was her eyes — they were gone. I gasped.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Octavia, what happened to you?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“They got my eyes with a billy hook.” She chuckled, but it wasn’t her usual raucous laughter. “I can be a nest-maid snake now, like the ones in the Southern Kingdoms.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No! No!” I couldn’t believe it. My dear Octavia had been trying to comfort me when she had lost both her eyes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The boisterous winds rocked us as the owls carried us toward the Glauxian Brothers retreat on the Bitter Sea.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">The Glauxian Brothers were renowned for their healing arts, but they couldn’t restore Octavia’s eyes. My own eye injury was minor in comparison. I have fierce scars around the socket and I can’t see out of it as well as before. But it was my talon that bothered me more. An Eagle Owl had grabbed me as I fell toward the sea and had broken one of my talons. The brothers tried their best to set it and gave me ointments and salves to rub into it. But the pain was almost constant and finally one night I’d had enough and I bit it off. What did I need a talon for? I was never going to hold a weapon again. I hung up my battle claws and swore never to put them on. I could hunt perfectly well with my remaining talons.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Octavia and I shared a hollow in one of a large circle of birch trees that composed the Glauxian Brothers retreat. The brothers were bound by a vow of silence, but they weren’t quite as strict about it as the Glauxian Sisters. They spent a good deal of the night chanting. There were several Boreal Owls among them, whose voices rang like chimes against the silver of the birches.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">I sank into a deep depression. For months on end, I hardly left the hollow except to hunt. It’s difficult for me to explain the strange feelings that afflicted me. I could not speak about them to anyone, not even to Octavia. Lil’s death was a wound that never healed. I thought at first that if I committed my feelings to verse and wrote about her, it would help. But each time I completed a poem, it was like peeling off a fresh scab.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">This was one I wrote after an evening hunt:</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">There is a gutter in the wind</span></p>

</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Octavia tended to my needs meticulously. She was becoming a nest-maid snake after all. It saddened me in many ways. She was so bright that it seemed a waste of time to me that she should spend her days slurping up vermin and keeping my hollow tidy. She even started to run her fangs lightly through my feathers to comb out my burrs. When I complained that she was squandering her talents, she very nicely told me to shut up. She said that what she did with her time was her business, and she didn’t relish living with a slob.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Little did I know that Octavia was hatching her own schemes. I don’t use the term “hatching” lightly here, for her schemes were aimed at bringing me new life.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">To say Octavia was fed up with my ways is perhaps an understatement. But she was also worried — worried sick, she told me later. She said it was as if I were withering away. She knew I had chronic pain in my injured talon, but after I bit it off and the pain vanished, she saw no improvement in me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Octavia can be chary with her words. In fact, unlike most creatures, I learned over the years that the less Octavia says, the more intensely she’s thinking. So one day she went to Brother Oliver’s study hollow, just off the Glauxian retreat library. I know of this only because Brother Oliver died recently, and a peregrine messenger delivered me his diary. I’ve copied his words exactly:</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">An extraordinary thing happened tonight, shortly after evensong. The words of the Glaux canticle were still ringing in my ear slits when the snake Octavia arrived. She is of a turquoise hue, a cyan celadon to be exact and, poor thing, she’s blind — she lost her eyes in the terrible Battle of the Ice Talons.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">She came to the retreat two moons before with the renowned Whiskered Screech Lyze, the Major General of the Glauxspeed Division. He refuses to answer to his military title now; indeed, he has completely renounced his rank and vowed never to fight again. Lyze and Octavia were both wounded, although Lyze’s injury appears to be one of the mind more than the body. That’s what Octavia came to speak with me about.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I can see you are troubled,” I said, hoping to offer a sympathetic ear slit.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Indeed, Brother Oliver.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It’s Lyze, I suspect.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You suspect right.” She inhaled sharply. “Lyze bit off his own talon because it was causing him so much pain. But now … but now …”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“But now,” I interjected, “the pain is gone, but the misery persists — like a scroom of what was.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Exactly!” she exclaimed. She paused as if trying to organize her thoughts. “Poor Lyze is pursued by many scrooms — most of all by the memory of his beloved mate, Lil. But there’s one thing that’s still alive for him, although I fear it will die soon if he doesn’t use it.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I must admit, I was a bit perplexed.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Go on,” I urged.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“He hasn’t engaged his mind. If he doesn’t soon, I’m afraid he’ll lose it!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I felt my gizzard tighten. Everyone knew that this Whiskered Screech, hatched on Stormfast Island, was one of the most brilliant owls in the Northern Kingdoms. He knew weather. He knew winds. His mind was fantastically perceptive and analytical. Now it was my turn to stammer.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It — it has surprised me that he has not taken more interest in our library.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes — for a mind like that to not have once peeked into this hollow with its rich collection of manuscripts and parchments! It’s surprising and disturbing.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“And what might we do about that?” I asked Octavia. Her answer stunned me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I want to be his eyes!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“B-b-b-but, how can you?” I stammered again.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You must read to me — anything from this library. It doesn’t matter what, but anything about the winds of the Shagdah Snurl would be particularly good. About the winds, not the legends, but physical descriptions, observations. He’ll like that. And I’ll —”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You’ll tell him about it? You’ll memorize it?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Not exactly,” she said. “I plan to write it down.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Can you write?” I didn’t mean it as an insult, but many Kielian snakes couldn’t!</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Of course I can write!” she snapped. “What do you take me for, a nincompoop?” Then she seemed to shrink up and falter. “I mean, I used to be able to write. And I have been practicing.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“How can you practice if you can’t see?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I can feel!” She had brought a small piece of parchment with her and she unfurled it. “Touch it!” she ordered. “With your third talon port side.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">This is an owl’s most sensitive talon. I did as she told me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I feel bumps,” I said. I was utterly confused.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes! But there is a pattern to the bumps. I punctured it with my own fangs, just as I used to dip them in ink pots to write.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What does it say?” I asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It says my name is Octavia. I was born on Stormfast Island. I was a big, fat creature and lazy as could be until I met Lyze — Lyze of Kiel, creator of the Glauxspeed Division, who saved my life and made me into a decent creature. That’s what it says.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I thought that I saw tears glistening in the dents that had been her eyes. “And if I can read to Lyze, perhaps I can rescue him, just as he rescued me.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I had never seen a snake more determined.</p>
