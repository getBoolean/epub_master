<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">She was large. She was lazy. Her parents had given up on her, but she had a prodigious intelligence. And she would become my best friend throughout the many long years that were to follow.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I had been flying over a slot in the cliffs where the sea broke in when I spotted a large — forgive me once more — bluish-green snake. She was reclining on a rock, hardly stirring. Indeed, I overheard her ask a blind nest-made snake to fetch her a minnow the next time it dove into the sea. <span class="italic">The nerve!</span> I thought. <span class="italic">Why doesn’t she get it herself?</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Suddenly, I remembered that Dylan had told me about an enormous and enormously lazy snake who looked just like this one. Dylan had met her mum and da once when she had worked for a spell in the honing pits. They had complained about their shiftless daughter, a problem snake and silly as a rockmunk. When she wasn’t lazing about, she was off flirting with fellows. I circled her three times with growing excitement before I alighted on a rock nearby.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Hrrh, hrrh!” I cleared my throat in an attempt to rouse her. Nothing. I coughed a bit louder and saw her eyelid flicker. “Pardon me,” I said. “I could not help but notice how handsome you are.” Her other eyelid flickered now — I was getting someplace. “I’ve never met a greenish-blue snake before.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">At that, she exploded from her relaxed position and coiled up, hissing like nothing I’d ever heard.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“And you’re not now!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You’re not meeting a greenish-blue snake, you poop-brained idiot! And what’s this ‘ish’ business? Sloppy language! Greenish-blue! Outrageous! An offense to my species, my class. Numbskull!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What are you, then?” I asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Let’s start with what I’m not! I’m not a cyan verdigris, but a cyan celadon.”<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn28" id="fn28"><span class="superscript">28</span></a></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh! I’m so sorry. For a snake of your beauty, your absolute pulchritude, I can imagine the offense.” I was really laying it on thick. I could tell I was dealing with a snake who wasn’t just lazy, but vain, too. I was willing to do almost anything to get her in the division. I sensed potential. Glaux knows how, but I did. If Moss could recruit snow leopards who spoke in a strange dialect that owls only half understood, I should be able to recruit this one snake.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Pulchritude?” she asked, a question in her voice. Perhaps she had never heard this word for beauty, or was impressed that I had. I pushed on. “There is a grandeur to you. An elegance enhanced by your size, and I suppose that is what first attracted me —”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The momentary flash of confusion in her eyes stopped me. “Are you trying to woo me, owl?” she said warily. Her eyelids closed, showing just glittering slit of green.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No, I was actually attracted to you for quite other reasons.” Now I clamped my beak shut. <span class="italic">Let her wonder!</span> Silence filled the air, and her scales began to twitch with curiosity.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Well?” she said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Well, what?” I replied with a half yawn.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Are you going to tell me what compelled you to light down and insult me with that ‘ish’ word?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I was playing her now. And rather enjoying it, I might add.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“A terrible breach of conduct on my part. Please forgive me.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Her eyes closed until I could see only a hint of sparkling cyan, like the tracery of a distant shooting star. “Listen, buster, I don’t give a white splat of seagull poop about apologies. Tell me why you decided to set yourself down here!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I leaned in. “This is top secret. You must not breathe a word to a soul.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Agreed,” she said curtly.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I have been charged by General Andricus Tyto Alba to form a new division for the war. We are recruiting the best of the best, not just owls, but snow leopards.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Snow leopards!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes and —” I paused a few seconds. “Kielian snakes.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Kielian snakes! How will they serve?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Some as ground troops, some in the air.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“In the air! How?” she demanded.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“They’ll fly on the top of owls,” I answered. “We have a training program going on now on Dark Fowl.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No!” she gasped.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes.” I could see I was beginning to reel her in. “We’ll set some snakes down in enemy territory. We especially want to use them for espionage.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Espionage.” The word slithered off her forked tongue.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Exactly. And beautiful snakes will be better able to insinuate themselves into situations than unattractive snakes. But I also need snakes that are large and strong.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I can bust rocks like nobody’s business, fella.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“My name is Lyze by the way. Lyze of Kiel.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Well, Lyze of Kiel, sign me up!” The snake paused and then uncoiled herself to lie flat, not for rest, but in a gesture of submission. “I am Octavia, your humble servant, willing to follow you into battle.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I cannot describe how touched I was by her words, her gesture. And she has been my humble servant through war and peace, through death and despair, through solemnity and joy. She kept me going when I thought there was not another wing beat in me. And, I might add, she never had another lazy day in her life.</p>
