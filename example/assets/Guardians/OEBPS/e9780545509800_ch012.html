<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">“So,” Moss said, flying out of his hollow, “I see your tantya Hanja has arrived.” I made a scathing sound deep in my throat. “You’re not alone,” Moss said. “Her showing up is enough to put the entire forest on edge.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Shhh,” I said as I picked up the first heartbeats of what I was certain was a white-footed mouse. Moss tilted his head to scoop up the tiny footfalls.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“We’ve got competition!” he said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“A Snowy. I know the wing beats.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Suddenly, out of the thickly falling snow, hurled a sooty sphere with wings. “Thora!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“They’re coming! They’re coming. It’s an attack!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Who? What?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Ice Talon commandos with fire claws.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Fire claws! No decent owl fought with fire claws. They were grosnik, forbidden, dirty weapons.<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn13" id="fn13"><span class="superscript">13</span></a></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Thora was armed to the beak. She had battle claws, a scimitar in one talon and a billy hook in the other. “They stole embers from my forge to load their claws. They’re coming!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Moss and I both hooted the alarm calls of our species. The Snowy alarm is like a hot needle piercing the air while my own is a hollow warble in a higher frequency. Within seconds, the small forest at our end of Stormfast Island was shrieking. Then, like fiends from hagsmire, the enemy swooped down on us.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Their faces were emblazoned with the double red crescents, the sign of their so-called sacred force. “Bhachtyr Bylyric!” they screeched as they raised the tips of their glowing fire claws in the name of Bylyric. Their battle cry did not frighten me, but it did sicken me. I felt my gizzard boil. I was ready to fight — to fight as savagely as any creature on Earth. It was as if I had instantly molted into a new bird, almost unrecognizable to myself. How my heart did pound. I felt nothing except rage, cool rage that left my brain clear. I was able to make a quick assessment of the battlefield: where they were and what they were fighting with.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Some were armed with scimitars, others with hot blades, hooks, thorns, and all manner of weapons including ice blades. Somehow their ice looked slightly different from the shards we saw harvested at the Ice Dagger. Elfstrom, the large Snowy from a neighboring tree, was back from the front and leaped into the air to engage a Burrowing Owl.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Burrowing Owls are not the best fliers. Their long, featherless legs are made for digging, and this one appeared to be digging at the air as if it were soil. In the process, he dropped his ice splinter. I swooped down and retrieved it. It was light and didn’t throw me off balance at all. I had seen owls practicing with the splinters on Dark Fowl and knew you could hurl an ice splinter or use it for talon-to-talon combat. I decided to hurl this one. As soon as I saw a space between Elfstrom and the Burrowing Owl open up, I raised my talon, aimed for the owl’s chest, and flung it. A spurt of blood smeared the night. The owl plummeted toward the ground.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“On your tail, Lyze!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I smelled singed feathers. My feathers! A Barred Owl with fire claws had attacked me from the rear. I operated on pure instinct and began backwinging, then flipped myself tailfirst into a small snowdrift and smothered the smoldering sparks. It was a contour, or covering feather, that had caught fire, and luckily not one of my filos.<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn14" id="fn14"><span class="superscript">14</span></a></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Brilliant!” a familiar voice called from above. I looked up. I was under my hollow’s tree and directly above me, a creature was swinging something that looked like a scaled flail. It was Gilda. She had transformed her head into a weapon and was swinging it at Ice Talon owls.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">But there was not time to marvel. I saw Thora and Moss together fending off a threesome of Barn Owls. There was a dead Great Gray nearby on the ground, his fire claws hissing softly in the snow as the coals in their tips expired. Beside him lay an ice scimitar four times the size of the splinter I’d hurled. I seized it with both my claws, then transferred it to my port talon. I realized immediately that I would have to compensate for its weight by stroking harder with my starboard wing, but I flew toward the rear of the three Barn Owls as fast as I could. They were flying in a tight formation, their wings almost touching, and they didn’t see me. But Moss and Thora saw it all. I lifted the scimitar and came down hard with it in the tight spaces between two of the owls. They screeched, and two tawny wings fell to the ground, their owners plummeting after. The third owl turned and opened his eyes wide with fear, but before he could maneuver, Thora and Moss were on him. They ripped open his back and tore off his tail.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Moss’s eyes glazed over with a look of absolute horror. “Your tree! Your tree!” he shrieked. There was a loud cracking sound and then a sweet smell. The tree burst into flame, fire leaping toward the sky and scorching the night.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Lysa!” I shrieked, and flew straight toward the fiery hollow. The sound of owls battling receded behind me. I had only one thought in my mind: Save my sister! The tree hissed and spat as boiling sap escaped from the trunk and branches. A dark mouth seemed to widen before me. It was the hollow, spewing black smoke. I flew in but could not breathe. I instinctively backed out. There simply was not enough air. But I was determined to try again. I’d find another way. I’d tear a hole in the trunk on the backside if I had to. The awful odor of seared feathers mixed now with the sweetness of the sap. I flew through the branches of the pine desperate to find a back way into my family’s hollow, choking and shreeing in horror. Then I felt something raking me from the tree. There was the cool draft of air in my lungs. And that was the last I remembered.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">“He’s coming around,” I heard someone whisper. I could still smell that sickeningly sweet odor of boiling sap from the burning tree. My eyes blinked open. Elfstrom was bending over me, his yellow eyes bright and anxious in a white face now black with soot. Thora’s and Moss’s faces were also darkened from the ashes and smoke. I tried to speak but began coughing and couldn’t get a word out.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Don’t try to talk.” Elfstrom patted me with his wing as gently as possible for he still wore his battle claws. I shut my eyes and, concentrating as hard as I could, tried not to cough. Finally, I gasped, “Lysa!” I saw Elfstrom glance nervously at Moss. Gilda slithered up to me. Her head had resumed its normal contours, and tears rolled out of both her eyes. “She’s gone, Lyze.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“They snatched her!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No, dear.” She shook her head wearily. “She’s dead.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">A revulsion pulsed through me. My gizzard quaked. <span class="italic">Dead? Lysa can’t … can’t be dead. She just budged. I was going to teach her to fly….</span> It was all so wrong.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Gundesfyrr, too,” Gilda said. “It was the smoke. They suffocated in the hollow and you nearly did, too.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Moss began to speak. “Gilda got to you and dragged you out.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I went back in for Lysa. I found her, but it was too late.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You found her?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“And Gundesfyrr.” She nodded slightly to one side. I twisted my head. There they lay. Next to Gundesfyrr’s rather large body, Lysa was nothing more than a little dark lump in the snow. All her lovely tawny feathers that had just begun to budge were an awful sooty color. And Gundesfyrr had been a handsome Spotted Owl, but not one of her spots showed through the black. Her sister, Prytlah, stood over her, weeping. But it was the sight of Tantya Hanja that made me shut my eyes. She had nary a scorched feather, not a trace of ash in her plumage. How had she escaped while the rest … I didn’t finish the thought. She was hunched over Lysa’s tiny body, weeping clamorously. I couldn’t look. I had to try and remember Lysa’s tawny feathers and the gray ones, and the flecks of white feathers that would have soon appeared over her eyes. <span class="italic">Mum was wrong</span>, I thought. <span class="italic">A pine tree isn’t the safest tree in the forest. It was the sap that caused it to ignite.</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">And Lysa? Lysa had passed over that border between Earth and glaumora. The echoes of her churring voice when she laughed at my pranks, the merry glint in her eyes when she heard me talk of flight — all these I would keep precious and bright. I would polish them as a smith polishes his metalwork to keep the gleam. She was not here on Earth with me, but she was somewhere. … <span class="italic">Somewhere</span>, I thought.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The rage that had overtaken my gizzard and my heart was still inside me. The savage bird within had been unrecognizable to me at first, but he was beginning to feel quite familiar. I slipped into his plumage as easily as during a spring molt. For the season of the soldier had arrived, and I was ready to tap that boiling rage again.</p>
