<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">“Can you believe it, Lyze? Tonight’s the night!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">What I really couldn’t believe was that Moss had actually delayed his first flight to Dark Fowl to wait for me. He wanted us to fly together. But as I was standing on that branch, a wind began to blow. Something about it caught my attention. There was a low whine at its edges and, every now and then, almost a gasp.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Hey, Lyze, what’s wrong? Bad pellet?” Moss hooted softly. I was wilfing before his eyes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No, no, Moss,” I said, looking up at him. “I don’t think we should go tonight.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What? What are you saying? Not go?! Lyze, this is what we have been waiting for forever! Going to Dark Fowl! Meeting Orf and his smiths.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">But I told him I wouldn’t and returned home.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My parents must have sensed something was wrong as soon as I entered the hollow.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“By Glaux, lad, looks like you’ve seen a scroom!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Not seen. Heard.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Heard? Heard what?” Da asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Out there, the wind suddenly shifted and it seemed to die. At first, it sounded like a mewling, like a baby animal … weak, frightened … and … and dying.” Both my parents gasped in horror.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I told you he had a feel for weather, Ulfa.” Da flipped his head around sharply at Mum, then back to me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It ain’t a baby, ain’t no chick, no cub,” my father said. “You might as well ram a hot blade through your gizzard. It’s the Snurls, and we ain’t flyin’ tonight.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“The Snurls?” I asked. The Shagdah Snurl was far to the north and was said to be the hatching place of the winds. Legend had it that the winds were caused by two battling sisters whose fight raked the Northern Kingdoms. Mum said legends sometimes made things more understandable. She said some owls needed stories to explain things beyond their control. “Some things,” she said, “are beyond what we can feel in our gizzards, know in our hearts, or can reason in our brains.” But now it began to feel as if the Snurl sisters had arrived at our hollow. For, by midnight, the rasp I’d heard had grown into a snarl and there was a terrible shaking of the tree. The very bark seemed to quiver.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Don’t worry,” Mum said from her perch on the nest. “We’re very safe here.” But I noticed that Gilda had wrapped herself around the base of the egg nest. “We must remain calm.” My mother adjusted her bandanna and sat erect on the nest. To me, she was not just a mum guarding her nest, but a commando heading into battle.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Don’t worry, dear. The tree won’t break. That is why Da and I chose this pine. It’s young and full of sap. A tree with sap doesn’t break. It bends with the wind, but never splinters.” But at that moment, the tree seemed to moan and I felt our hollow tip slightly. “It won’t break, I promise you,”<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn8" id="fn8"><span class="superscript">8</span></a> Mum said, and reached out a talon to pat me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">And for the rest of the night, she told me stories about the Shagdah Snurl, this incredible place that was part legend but part real, where rocks melted, sisters squabbled, and the winds hatched. I was mesmerized.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">By the next evening, our world in the grove was calm. The winds had subsided and we were ready to fly to Dark Fowl. Mum let Gundesfyrr sit on the nest so she could see us take off. From the neighboring pine, a family of Sooty Owls perched to wave good-bye and, of course, across the way, Moss’s family had gathered on the large branch outside their hollow. I always felt it was quite beautiful when Moss and his da, Arne, spread their lovely white wings, but at this moment I felt my wings, though smaller, were equally beautiful with their mottling of brown and gray and tawny feathers with accents of white.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My heart was pounding and my gizzard a-jitter. I had been too excited to eat and, besides, I wanted to fly light. It was as if every feather, right down to my plummels, was anticipating each wind riffle and draft it might encounter. I wanted to embrace the wind, the sky, the very stars. How lucky I was to have been born a bird, and not just any bird, but an owl! For what other creature can fly with such grace, carve the wind with such elegance, and pass through the air in utter silence?</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">Regard the map and you will see that between Stormfast Island and Dark Fowl there is another island, the Ice Dagger. I had studied that map the previous morning until Mum made me go to sleep. Now, with the wind coming in from the southeast, we had to take a quartering tack and fly several degrees off the shortest route, which took us directly over the Dagger. A tailwind would have made everything much easier, but Moss and I were ecstatic. For the Dagger was where the ice was harvested for the premier ice weapons — those used by the Frost Beaks, the Ice Lancers, the Ice Squires, and all the elite ice regiments of the Kielian League. As we flew over the Point of Hock, I scanned the cliffs for Hoke, but there was no sign of him. I was determined to meet up with him again.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Not long after, my father flipped his head back, twisting it as only owls can due to the extra bones in their necks that allow us to swivel in a wider arc than any other creature. My father had not only twisted his head back, but flipped it entirely upside down. “Young’uns, you can catch your first glimpse of some harvesters near the point of the Dagger.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We saw them immediately: two Short-eared Owls and a Barn Owl hovering in the air.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Our fathers began to talk about the harvesting blades they were using. “I think the Barn Owl is using a tactical planar blade while the two Short-ears are working with the standard ice chisel,” Da said. “Arne, how about we take the lads in for a close-up view?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Moss and I were beside ourselves and started to hoot with joy.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Now, lads!” My father turned to us. “None of that. Ice harvesting is serious business. One slip of the blade can be disastrous. We have to hang back and let these owls concentrate. When they finish their business, they might take a break and talk to us. But be quiet for now.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Arne added, “Do nothing to distract them.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">A warm thermal conveniently rose out of nowhere so that we could soar quietly above the harvesters and observe their work. These owls were not simply magnificent fliers who did complex wing work to keep close to the blade of the Ice Dagger, but they were master craftsmen. Below the harvesters, two more Short-ears and a Barn Owl flew with what looked like slings suspended from their talons.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Scrappers,” my father whispered.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“The ones with the slings. They’re apprentices to the ice harvesters. Their main job is to collect the shards as the masters sheer them off. See how carefully they watch for when a shard is about to break off?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My gizzard quivered with excitement. I wanted to be a scrapper. How much one could learn!</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Something caught my father’s attention. The first thread of a newing moon glimmered behind the scrim of dark scudding clouds. Suddenly, there was a sound I had never heard — a sizzling scratch in the air. Sparks flew and blood splattered the night. For a brief instant, it was as if we were all frozen in a crimson rain. And then I saw a wingless Short-eared Owl plummet toward the sea.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It’s an attack!” the Barn Owl cried. He drew an ice shard from the sling his scrapper carried.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Quick! To the ledge, lads!” Da shrieked. <span class="italic">What ledge?</span> I looked down at the sharp vertical blade of the ice cliff beneath me, shimmering in the night.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Behind the blade on the other side!” Arne rasped. They herded us to the far side of the island.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Who are they?” Moss asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I could see the disbelief in both our fathers’ eyes. “Hireclaws for the Ice Talons League? B-but — but —” my da stammered. “How could this be?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Arne swiveled his head around madly. “They’ve never come this far west, this far into civilian air — and — and territory. This is so far from the front!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Or what we thought was the front,” my father said ominously.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You lads stay here,” Arne replied. There was a distinct alarm in the Snowy’s eyes. This was not how our first flight to Dark Fowl was supposed to go. Not at all.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What are you going to do?” Moss asked. “You and Rask don’t have weapons!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, you do!” It was the shree of the Barn Owl scrapper, who plunged in with his sling. “Take an ice shard, you two. They’re not finished, but they’ll work. Let the owlets take these ice hooks. Don’t use them until you have to,” the Barn Owl said. “You toss the hooks. First power up and then lob them. You’ve played lob and gob, haven’t you?” We both nodded. “Same idea.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">He was off before we could ask any more questions.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Da looked at us. “Stay here. Don’t move. Be alert and you’ll be safe.” He swallowed. “Don’t use those weapons unless you absolutely have to.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">And then they were gone. Thick clouds rolled in, making it harder to see. We heard terrible screeches tearing the night. The shree of a Barn Owl is one of the most gizzard-shattering sounds on Earth. But were our Barn Owls, the harvester and his scrapper, being torn to pieces or was it a war whoop? Feathers drifted lazily through the darkness. It was impossible to tell to whom they belonged: a Short-eared Owl or a Barn Owl or — and these we dreaded seeing the most — the pure white feathers of a Snowy or the mottled brown-gray ones of a Whiskered Screech.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Suddenly, a white face rimmed with tawny feathers appeared out of the clouds just below the ledge, shooting up toward us. There was a strange mark between its eyes, bloodred, but not made from blood, a double crescent shape that talons make when tearing flesh. I realized it had been painted with a stain extracted from bingle berries. It had a terrifying impact on me, for there was something almost hypnotic about the design.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The owl raised talons sheathed in metal. I heard the click of his battle claws extending and smelled the rank odor of day-old vole on his breath as his beak dropped open to screech the kill chant. The claws were a whisker’s breadth from my ear slit, set to rake off half my face.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Moss and I leaped into the air. I heard the sound of those claws raking the ledge where I was perched just a second before and then a terrible sizzle as if something hot had touched the ice. I flipped my head around. The owl was coming at me, the double extension talon on his battle claws reaching for me. And they were fire claws. Their tips glowed like the eyes of a hagsfiend, and I could feel the radiating heat on my tail feathers. If he touched me, I would ignite like a ball of fire.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The Barn Owl was chasing us. The ice hook was heavier than I thought and my flight balance was off. I wobbled a bit at first, then recovered. A few seconds later, I sensed a new wind in my feathers. It was what I can best describe as a “curling gust.” Whiskered Screeches are small owls. What we lack in raw power, we make up for in agility. How I felt I could do this I am not sure, but I flipped myself over on that curl of wind so that I was flying upside down, or rather belly up, cradled in the gutter of a sustained gust.<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn9" id="fn9"><span class="superscript">9</span></a> Above me, I could see the flash of the Barn Owl’s battle claws in the night. My gizzard nearly seized up because he was directly above me, but he seemed not to realize it.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The soft white feathers of his belly gleamed. The peculiar markings I had seen on his face, the double crescent, haunted me still. I had no battle claws. I had the hook, but it wasn’t the best weapon for what I was hoping to do. But my talons were sharp. Suppose I clawed him? Without thinking any further, I thrust both my talons up at once. The impact wasn’t much, but the shock was huge. The Barn Owl squawked and tipped precariously. I saw something slice through the night, and the Barn Owl lurched. Moss’s ice hook had fastened onto his port battle claws. Moss had him tethered, and his belly was bleeding from where I had clawed him.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You got him!” It was Arne, Moss’s father, crying out. Blood coursed down one of his own wings, but he was flying steadily. Then my father and two of the harvesters appeared. The Short-eared harvester plunged toward the hireclaw Barn Owl with an immense ice shard and stabbed him in the belly to finish him off.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">He flew back, pointing. “We’ll fetch up on the Dagger,” said the harvester.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">We flew to a narrow rocky beach on the lee side of the Ice Dagger. There were nine of us in all. The Short-eared harvester, a female named Aiyunne, extended a wing and patted her scrapper, Bela, who was sobbing. The only time I had ever seen a grown-up crying was when I was hatched out, and the messenger came and told of Edvard’s death. And though I didn’t know the owl who had died, my eyes also filled with tears.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Moss was trembling. “Wh … what …” Before he got the words out, I knew what he was going to ask. “What were those marks, those red marks on their faces?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Ah!” Arne sighed deeply.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“The double crescent — an ancient Krakish symbol, evoking Bhachtyr.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Bhachtyr?” Moss and I both said at once.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“The Sacred Force from ancient times — Bhachtyr the Destroyer. Bylyric has taken this as his symbol. Sometimes they have a strange effect. We’re used to seeing it, but the first time it’s hard. Rough on the gizzard.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Aiyunne, the Short-eared harvester, gave a muffled sob. Her scrapper turned to her. “I’m so sorry about Piet.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“He’s down there someplace, isn’t he? He can’t even have a proper burial!”<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn10" id="fn10"><span class="superscript">10</span></a></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Is — is —” I began stuttering.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What, son?” My da turned to me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Never mind,” I replied in a small voice.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I was going to ask if the owl, the owl I had never even met, was really dead. But I knew that was stupid, childish. I kept peering down into the tumult of the Everwinter Sea expecting to see the owl emerge. How could someone be here one minute and gone the next? I had to stop myself from saying the dumbest thing of all, the most babyish thing of all: <span class="italic">no fair!</span> Can you imagine ever hearing a soldier, a warrior, cry “no fair”? The order of the universe had gone yoickers.</p>
