<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">On my first day back on Dark Fowl, I found myself in General Andricus Tyto Alba’s hollow with his topmost advisors explaining my ideas for a “newfangled” fighting force.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“The unit would be very small compared to most commando units,” I explained.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“How small is small?” the general asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“A dozen, no more.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“A dozen!” Captain Nillja Micrathene Whitneyi exclaimed. She was an Elf Owl who had distinguished herself in the Frost Beaks’ unit as a superb strategist.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, Captain.” They were all looking at me very skeptically, except for the general. They would only be more incredulous when I revealed my plans for Kielian snakes. I thought I might as well get that over with quickly.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Small, but a mix of species,” I added.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The owls in attendance all blinked. There were derisive snorts and hisses.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Let him finish,” General Andricus shushed them with a wave of his port wing.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I propose using Kielian snakes, mostly as ground troops.” This wasn’t entirely accurate, but I didn’t want to startle them with the idea of snakes in flight on the backs of owls. There was complete and utter silence, but the air reeked with contempt.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“And I suppose he has a role for, let us guess — white-footed mice?” an ancient Barred Owl muttered under his breath. I knew this was my biggest problem — getting these owls to begin to think of Kielian snakes as actual soldiers and not just mindless rock crunchers or honers. I stole a glance at the general. He seemed lost in deep thought, his white, heart-shaped face as blank as a pale winter sky. When at last he swiveled his head toward me, there was a shimmer in his black eyes that snuffed out the din of scornful whispers.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“And have you thought of what such a unit might be called?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I felt a calm creep through my gizzard, which had been fraught with tension. <span class="italic">He’s with me</span>, I thought. <span class="italic">The general is with me.</span> And a name came to me, I’m not sure from where. I took a step closer to him and spoke up in a strong voice. “The Glauxspeed unit, sir.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">His black eyes brightened. “And a fine name it is. Glauxspeed! What do you say to a division?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Everyone gasped. General Andricus swiveled his head to fix each owl in the small assemblage with his fierce, dark gaze. “A division composed of several of these hyper-maneuverable units. Together, we would call them the Glauxspeed Division.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“B-b-but, sir —” Captain Nillja began to sputter.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“He’s just a young’un!” a Barred Owl interrupted. “He doesn’t even graduate until, when?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Soffen issen,” I said softly. I was completely confused. Certainly, General Andricus was not suggesting that I command a division?</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">He must have read my mind, for he turned to me and said, “Listen to me, Lyze of Kiel.” I started, as did everyone else, for he did not address me as Cadet Lyze Megascops. This was an egregious departure from protocol. I was almost dizzy now with confusion. I felt all eyes settling upon me in anticipation of what General Andricus was about to say. “I am not suggesting that you lead this division at all. You don’t have the experience in the field — yet. But you have an idea. You picture all this in your mind’s eye, do you not, lad?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, sir, I suppose I do.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You flew out and rescued Orf. A small unit of mixed species rescued the best blacksmith in the Northern Kingdoms.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The general lofted himself onto a higher perch and paused until a hush enveloped the hollow. It was so quiet that as I watched a plummel fall from the cantankerous Barred Owl, I swore I could hear it touch the floor.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You see, my friends,” the general continued in a gentler tone, “we’re at a critical juncture in the war. The war is changing and it’s coming closer to home. I have just been informed of three more attacks on peaceful communities.” He paused again. “I cannot make this clear enough.” His voice swelled. “We are losing! As of this moment, the Ice Talons League has gained more territory than they have lost to us. By soffen issen, our slipgizzles tell us the front will be here — here, at Dark Fowl Island! Bylyric is planning a massive invasion, and he and his forces will fly on west and south. Yes, it’s true. They’ve set their sights on the Southern Kingdoms. On Ga’Hoole!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I felt a darkness fill my gizzard. It began to twist and twitch. The Elf Owl Captain Nillja staggered on her tiny feet.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Ga’Hoole!” someone whispered.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">General Andricus flipped his head. “The great tree itself. And we’re all that stands between them,” he said quietly. “Cadet Lyze has seen over the murky horizon, a horizon stained by the blood and smoke of old methods of combat. We need new, young flexible minds quick with imagination to invent new strategies if we are to have any chance. And that is exactly what Cadet Lyze, Cadet Loki, Cadet Lil, Cadet Blix, Cadet Moss, and the master’s apprentice Cadet Thora can offer. The success of this division depends not simply on training, however, but on secrecy and surprise. I cannot emphasize that enough. Secrecy and surprise! The Ice Talons must never know what’s coming if we’re to retain any advantage.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“So you are elevating these young cadets to the rank of division and battery officers?” a Spotted Owl asked with more than a tinge of contempt.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No. Not now, Major Fina Strix Occidentalis. But soon. For now they shall become instructors in this new form of fighting. We need to have this division ready by spring. We must be able to meet Bylyric’s invasion with hidden strength. Bylyric plans to be here, here where I perch.” His eyes bore into the Spotted Owl. <span class="italic">Let that sink in</span>, he seemed to be saying. <span class="italic">Imagine a tyrant on this perch.</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Lyze,” he said, “tonight a new cadet arrives, a certain Cadet Strumajen Strix.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“The daughter of Commander Strix Hurth who used to teach here?” someone asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“The very same.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“But she was a terrible problem to her parents, disobedient, disinterested in her studies. Dis — dis —” the Spotted Owl began to sputter.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“And now distinguished,” General Andricus said coldly, leveling those impossible dark eyes that looked like dead coals in his white face. “Yes, Major Fina Strix Occidentalis, she was not fit for entry into the Academy here. She had to go to the second-rate school — Gareth’s Keep, up by Little Hoole. But two evenings ago, we received a falcon messenger with the news that an earthquake in the region had destroyed the remaining walls of the fortress there, making Little Hoole vulnerable. Wave upon wave of Ice Talon units stormed the breach. Apparently, under the most unimaginably terrible conditions, this young owl, whom everyone had always thought was a huge disappointment …” The general lingered on the last word so that the sound of it seemed to sizzle through the chamber. “She drove them off. This cadet acquitted herself with unmatched courage and, when forced into a seemingly untenable position, managed to fend off a much larger enemy force. She will be invaluable to the formation of the Glauxspeed Division.” And then under his breath, perhaps so as not to offend the older owls who were gathered in this hollow, he muttered, “We need bold, new owls, with bold, new ideas.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Glauxspeed Division!</span> The words rang in my ears and rattled my gizzard. I was still dizzy from all the general had said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I was not to be an officer, at least not yet. But I was to be an instructor — this seemed to me an even more daunting promotion. How did one transform oneself from student to teacher that quickly? By soffen issen, that was the deadline. For that was when the fight would arrive here — here at Dark Fowl Island.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The image of Lysa as a small, dark lump on the snow came back to me in all its horror. The soot on her tawny new feathers seemed to stain the whole world. The rumors about Bylyric abounded. Some said he was part hagsfield, that beneath the white plumage of a Snowy, there were the dark feathers of the ancient hag owls who had practiced nachtmagen in the time of the legends. If that was so, what good would my newfangled ideas and strategies do? My strategies were based on logic, developing a keen sense of the weather, advances in weapons, and most of all, faith in ordinary creatures being trained to do extraordinary things. And faith was not magic.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The idea of a small unit had been tested in a limited way when we rescued Orf. But “limited” was the key word here. There had been six of us. Now we were talking about an entire division made up of many smaller units, each very specialized in a new way, yet able to work together when needed.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Loki, Blix, Moss, Lil, and I — the five of us together must show the others.</p>
