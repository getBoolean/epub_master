<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">Our new hollow was in a stand of stout blue spruce. I could imagine that in the winter when the snow stayed fast on the ground, it would be lovely. This type of spruce, as its name indicates, has a bluish tinge, and the shadow it casts would fall like a blue filigree net on the white snow. By the time I arrived, my new brother, Ifghar, had hatched. Like many owlets that hatch at this time of year, he was advanced. Summer chicks tend to be that way. The hunting is good, so they grow faster. He was fledging out nicely, but all right, I’ll admit it right here: He did not capture my heart the way Lysa had. But he was a good little fellow and he worshipped me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Mum and Da seemed fine. One morning toward twixt time, I remembered something very clever and funny that Lysa had said about the sun just as it was rising.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Mum, Da,” I said. “Once at twixt time, Lysa peeked out the hollow and said that the sun reminded her of a —” But the words died on my beak because both my parents swiveled their heads toward me and glared.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Never mind,” I whispered. It was clear that I was not ever to mention Lysa, the old hollow, or even Gundesfyrr again. Lingering emotions were considered a sign of weakness among seasoned soldiers of the Kielian League. There had been a period of mourning, and they believed that prolonging it served no purpose. It was as if that part of our lives had been sealed off forever.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Oddly enough, it wasn’t until I had been there for nearly an entire day and night that I thought of Gilda. I was shocked that I had not noticed her absence. Perhaps I, too, had begun to seal off those memories. Before I could stop myself, a question slid out.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Mum, what happened to Gilda?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, I let her go.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Let her go! How could you? She saved my life.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Well, she wasn’t a very good housekeeper. I felt I could do it better. She was very distractible. I think nest-maiding wasn’t really in her … how should I put it … her skill set?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I nearly exploded. I wanted to say, <span class="italic">You’re darned right, it wasn’t.</span> Gilda was a fighter, a warrior if I ever saw one.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My mum continued, “I felt I could take care of this new hollow as well as any nest-maid snake.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My mother was betraying a sudden streak of domesticity that was completely unlike her. The first thing she had announced upon my arrival was that she’d had no broody for Ifghar. She seemed enormously proud of having brooded him herself. I dared not ask if she was contemplating retirement.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My father was not considering any such thing. Indeed, he was called back to the front on the eve of Ifghar’s First-Meat-on-Bones ceremony. At dawn before he left, Da and I went out to hunt for rockmunks, which were at their tenderest this time of year and perfect for Ifghar. Their flesh has an almost creamy consistency.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Mum had a funny light in her eye as she greeted us on the branch outside when we returned. A familiar trill issued forth from deep in the hollow.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“But look who’s here!” My gizzard locked. It was Tantya Hanja. “I’m just in time,” she said, waddling forth. No wonder my mum had that odd look in her eye. “One family member has to leave, but another arrives. Nothing like having family about when it comes to these ceremonies!” Tantya Hanja cackled.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“But I want my da,” whined Ifghar.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“He’ll be here for the ceremony, dear,” my mother said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“But then he’ll have to leave right after,” Ifghar complained.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I am here, darling lad,” Tantya Hanja said. “I know all the songs.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I don’t like the way you sing. It hurts my ear slits.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Ifghar! Shame on you,” Mum scolded. But I nearly laughed out loud.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">It was not the jolliest of ceremonies, although we all did our best. I kept thinking about Gilda and wishing she had been there. She always told such good stories. Who cared about her skills as a nest-maid?</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">A very nice Barred Owl family and another family of Barn Owls stopped in. Moss, bless his soul, showed up at the last minute with his three sisters, who had grown into lovely lasses and would be returning to the Academy with us come autumn.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I noticed that everyone perched as far away as possible from Tantya Hanja. I found myself actually feeling sorry for her. Once upon a time she’d had a mate, but he died rather young. She led a very lonely life. Some say that she had attempted to be a gadfeather, but her voice was such that she never had a real following. The one time she had attended the yearly spring equinox gathering of gadfeathers, she performed to an audience of one, an elderly Whiskered Screech who had seemed quite besotted by her but had dropped dead within hours of hearing her sing. That fixed her reputation not simply as a terrible singer, but as an ill-omened owl.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Thinking about all this depressed me greatly, especially as I hadn’t received any messages from Lil since I had returned home. Every day I looked for a Great Horned Owl messenger. Great Horneds were most often messenger owls, for they flew the fastest of all of us. I also looked for a falcon, just in case. Falcons can fly twice as fast as any owl,<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn23" id="fn23"><span class="superscript">23</span></a> but were generally reserved for military messaging.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I had written to Lil once but hadn’t received any reply and was uncertain if I should write to her again. I didn’t want to seem too eager, but I <span class="italic">was</span> eager, darn it! Four days after Ifghar’s Meat-on-Bones ceremony, I couldn’t help myself and took a charred twig to begin to scratch something out on a piece of birch bark.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What’cha doing?” Ifghar asked, trying to perch beside me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What does it look like I’m doing?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Writing a letter.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“That’s right.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Who to?” Ifghar could be a little annoying at times. And once he started asking questions, they multiplied endlessly.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“A friend.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What kind of friend?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Just somebody I met at the Academy!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What kind of somebody?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Really, Ifghar! How can I write if you keep interrupting me?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Quit pestering Lyze, Ifghar. Come help me tuck in this rabbit’s ear moss.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I bet it’s a girlfriend!” Ifghar hooted. “Ha-ha-ha! Lyze has a girlfriend! Lyze has a girlfriend!” He began to dance around the hollow chanting this annoying refrain.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Why don’t you just go outside and announce it to the whole world!” I exploded.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I think I will.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">He had just started branching and was quite full of himself. He had taken right to it. I could hear him outside hopping about. Then suddenly, he gasped. “Mum, a messenger’s coming!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I was out of the hollow in no time and flew up to where Ifghar had perched. My gizzard was thumping. It was a Great Horned with a scroll in his talons.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I would have been here sooner, but this was passed on to me. The falcon was … er, intercepted.” I felt a twinge of anguish.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Is — is it for me?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The Great Horned looked at me narrowly. “Not unless you’re Major Ulfa Megascops Trichopsis.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Oh, great Glaux</span>, I thought, trying to still my gizzard. “No, I’m not,” I said softly. “I’ll get her.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My mum took the scroll with trembling talons. I didn’t need to hear the news — we both knew what a scroll like this meant.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Her beak quivered as she read the words: “‘Dear Major Ulfa Megascops Trichopsis, it saddens me to inform you that your mate, General Raskin Megascops Trichopsis, supreme commander of the Kielian League, fell in battle in the H’rath Range two nights ago. General Rask died serving his league valiantly. He took an ice sword straight to the gizzard.’”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Death had touched us again. First Edvard, then Lysa, and now my da. Death bears with it a stain that seeps into the hollow and fills the mind. Those first days when dawn came and I tried to sleep while hearing the soft mewling of my mother, my thoughts were streaked with memories of Da and me together and our wonderful flight to the Hock. It was all I could think about. In my dreams, it was my father who flew into the sea smoke and seemed to dissolve before my eyes as the smoke thickened. The dreamscape merged with the suffocating smoke of the fiery pine from the night when Lysa died. The haunting scent of the sweet, boiling sap suffused my dreams, almost like the scroom of the tree.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">That smell had clung to my feathers for days after Lysa’s death. I remember being so glad when I molted that season, for at last the cloying odor was gone. But now it came back again to haunt my dreams — my dreams of death.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My mother became deeply morose and, as the nights passed, only seemed to be getting worse. Until this point, my experience with grief had been limited to Lysa’s death. I had known Lysa for just a few scant moons, and I couldn’t imagine how difficult it must be to lose a mate you had known for countless moons, for years. Mum became so quiet and so unresponsive to Ifghar, who was a demanding little owlet, that I asked her if it might not be a good idea to get a new nest-maid snake. Mum seemed obsessed with trailing around the nest and cleaning up vermin.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No!” she said. “I need something to keep me busy.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Don’t I keep you busy?” Ifghar asked plaintively.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, Ifghar, you have Lyze,” she said, trying to sound cheerful. “He’s teaching you wonderful things. How’s your flying coming along?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“He says I’ll soon be ready to fly to the Hock.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I couldn’t wait until he was ready, for I really wanted to try to find Hoke. I had not stopped thinking about my ideas, or how General Andricus Tyto Alba had encouraged me to think about what he called the “newfangled ways of fighting.” One evening, when my mother’s silence lay as thick as brikta schnee in the middle of winter and I felt I couldn’t stand it one more minute, I turned to her.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Mum,” I said, flipping my head around to where she was distractedly petting some of Ifghar’s new feathers. “When I was at the Academy, I had … had —” I wasn’t sure how to begin.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Had what?” Ifghar said. “A girlfriend?” he said, smirking. I remember wondering how a little owlet knew how to smirk. It felt unseemly in one so young.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No, Ifghar,” I snapped. “I had some ideas about warfare.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My mum blinked. “Really, dear?” It was the first time since the news of Da’s death that I had seen a genuine sparkle in her eye. It illuminated our hollow like a blast of sunlight.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, Mum, and General Andricus Tyto Alba encouraged me to come up with more over the break.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Andricus himself! Well, tell me about it.” She turned to my brother. “Don’t interrupt as you often do. Try to listen, Ifghar.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I took a deep breath. “Mum, how big is your commando unit, the Ice Daggers?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Twenty owls.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“All Whiskered Screeches?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No, a couple of Barn Owls.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“But generally, what you would call midsized owls.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, definitely. Midsized owls are best with Ice Daggers. That’s what a commando unit is, after all: a specialized unit composed of owls who are skillful with certain weapons.” She paused and looked at me. “Why all these questions?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What if we redefine specialized to still mean focused, but include a mixture of owls of different sizes that excel with more than just one weapon?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You’re losing me here.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I had blessedly lost Ifghar, too, for he had fallen sound asleep. However, my mother continued to listen attentively as I explained. She occasionally stopped me to ask a question. The notion of the support of Kielian snakes staggered her.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Snakes? I hope you’re joking! They have no native intelligence. They’re lazy —”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“They’ve never been challenged, Mum. We don’t know what they might be capable of. Please hear me out.” I paused. I knew what I was going to say next was going to be difficult. “Mum, when our pine tree was hit by those hireclaws, you could have lost me, as well. It was Gilda who saved me. She couldn’t save Lysa or Gundesfyrr, but she saved me.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Mum’s eye teared up. I extended my wing tip and stroked her back feathers. “She found me, Mum, and she dragged me to safety. Kielians are very strong.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I know,” she replied in a small voice. “At least, that’s what they say. But what exactly are you getting at, Lyze? Because, although they may have many good attributes, they aren’t owls. They can’t fly.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I’m not worried about that now,” I said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I’m so relieved,” Mum said, somewhat sarcastically. Her tone didn’t bother me in the least. I was delighted to see that I had genuinely engaged her in this conversation. She seemed to be emerging just a bit from her fog of grief.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I closed my eyes for a moment and drew in my mind a picture of a fleet, a light-armored unit. A striker unit! That’s what it would be. Because we would strike before a conflict could even begin. We would complete daring midair reloads, and Kielian snakes would serve as nimble ground forces. The notion of a few — for a few was all it would take — Kielian snakes smashing a repository of ice weapons to smithereens was riveting. Bylyric might be a tyrant. He was brutal. He fought savagely, but not with his head. We would bring a new kind of war to the Orphan Maker.</p>
