<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">The second Octavia returned, the general sent a sergeant to fetch me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">When Lil and I arrived at the general’s hollow, we could tell that Octavia was exhausted.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Octavia!” I gasped. “Are … are you all right?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">General Andricus stepped toward me. “She found him.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I blinked. “You found Bylyric?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Octavia raised her head to give me a tired smile. “He’s there. Middle talon of the Ice Talons.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“And you’re all right?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Of course I’m all right! I’m just tired!” she snapped. I blessed her crankiness. It meant she was indeed okay.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The general’s white face seemed to glow like a full moon in the dim light of the chamber. His voice was a hoarse whisper. “He’s there and we have to move fast! We have to get him before he moves.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">For years, Bylyric’s precise whereabouts had been a mystery. My parents had discussed sighting him when I was just a newly hatched owlet. Just when the Kielian League thought we had him, he would seem to dissolve like mist in the sun. Some whispered that he was no mere owl, that there was something supernatural about him. But I had always known that he was just an ordinary owl with an extraordinary lust for power.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">And now, thanks to Octavia’s intelligence, we had him. If we could find and eliminate Bylyric, it would destroy the morale of the Ice Talons and stop their invasion in its tracks. Our plan was to get Bylyric and then surprise the Ice Talons with a full-scale invasion.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We listened carefully as Felix, a Boreal Owl who was a master cartographer, clawed at a rat-skin map of the Ice Talons. “This is the compound in the second or middle talon of the Ice Talons. Several ice notches run off the main passage. He’s confined to this one. As far as we can tell, it’s the only one that can accommodate his wingspan.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Are there guards with him?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Of course,” said Felix. Patches the snow leopard growled in agreement.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Between our best slipgizzles, Moss’s matchless team of snow leopards, and a cadre of Kielian snakes, we had managed to gather excellent intelligence. Now our main fear was that Bylyric had moved again in the time since Octavia had pinpointed his location. So far, our slipgizzles in the region, including the resistance leaders, had seen no sign of this. The slipgizzles had obtained profiles on all of Bylyric’s owl guards and had been able to track each one of them. The maze that constituted the Ice Talons was seemingly endless, and one could easily get lost. But the real problem was the constricted fighting space. “The big questions are,” I said, “do we go in or flush him out into the open? Is it to be a full-scale air strike or a targeted raid?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“We should plan for both,” Lil said. I looked up at her.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">For the first time we were to be together in battle. My gizzard clenched. I didn’t know if I could stand to see Lil in such danger. When the meeting broke up, I waited in agony for the general to send word that it was time to strike.</p>
