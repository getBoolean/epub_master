<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">“Look at his feathers,” Blix said as we inched closer.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Feathers but no wings!” Loki whispered.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I don’t think those are feathers,” I said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What are they?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I’m not sure,” I replied, peering at the strange creature. “How did he get here?” I asked. “You said the slot just opened before you went to the Academy.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“There’s a crevasse at the very top. We hadn’t noticed it when we used to fly up here, because it’s iced over. This Other must have fallen through long, long ago.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The Other was the most peculiar creature I had ever seen. No myth could have been stranger than the truth that confronted me. I poked gently at the body. It swayed slightly. It was definitely not clad in feathers. Its covering was made from some kind of woven material, like so many of the relics discovered in the ruins of Others in the Southern Kingdoms. A peculiar contraption was attached to his back, almost like a very large botkin a blacksmith might carry. Metal objects that looked like gizzard rippers hung from the creature’s sides. They roused my curiosity. I hovered in the air, examining them more closely, then swiveled my head toward Loki and Blix.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I don’t like the idea of filching from the dead, but I think we must take some of these metal objects.”<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn32" id="fn32"><span class="superscript">32</span></a></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“But is it dead?” Loki asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It’s dead all right,” I replied.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“We thought …” Blix seemed to hesitate. She began again. “We thought at first maybe it was a frozen scroom.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“A scroom? A ghost? No!” I said. “Not at all. This is too … too real to be a scroom.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Scrooms are sort of real,” Blix muttered.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I had never seen a scroom, but I had heard enough about them. Scrooms were the restless souls of owls that roamed the Earth because they had unfinished business and could not yet leave for glaumora, the owl heaven. I pecked slightly at the creature again. It was dead.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">On his head, it wore a strange thing that looked somewhat like the helmets favored by warrior owls of Ga’Hoole, but it wasn’t made of metal. Some of the same color fur that grew on his face also blushed out from beneath his helmet, only much thicker.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I thought about what Blix had just said — how scrooms were sort of real. I turned to look at the tiny owl. “Yes, scrooms are sort of real. I won’t deny that such things exist, but I feel they exist because of our memories. We have no memories of this creature, so it cannot be a scroom.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I was not sure if what I said was true, but it felt true to me. I realize that this is a peculiar comment from an owl like myself, who purports to be a scientist and relies on data, testing, and experimentation.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I pecked at the creature again. “You can’t peck at a scroom,” I said. “It would simply dissolve.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">This Other wasn’t dissolving. Far from it. Indeed, I began to wonder if the reason it was so well-preserved had something to do with the frigid temperatures and dry air of the Nacht Sted.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">For the next several hours, the three of us worked on picking loose the metal spikes and the loops that hung from his side. Loki and Blix agreed with me that it was important for Orf and Thora to take a careful look at these. We didn’t think they were weapons, but perhaps we could adapt them in some way for combat.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Can you fly with that, Blix?” I said, looking at her as she took off from a ledge with a loop in her talons.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It’s heavy, but if I can balance it just right, I think I can,” she said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We were most interested in the spike. On further examination of the Other’s botkin, we discovered a quiverlike object into which the spike fit.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Interesting,” Loki said as he shoved a spike into the quiver. I heard a tiny click as if something had engaged. Suddenly, there was a load crack and a flame shot from the quiver, the spike whizzing by Blix and missing her by a sliver. It stuck in the wall of ice, still burning.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Holy Glaux!” she exclaimed, staggering in the air with the loop still clutched in her talons. “That wasn’t a quiver — it’s a launcher!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“A fire launcher!” Loki said. “This is far more dangerous, far more powerful than fire claws, and it doesn’t damage our talons. This is the weapon of the future!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I was still dazed by what we’d seen. My eyes fastened on that flame that was still burning in the ice wall. How had the spike been ignited in the first place? I recalled the click I had heard just before the loud crack. Had there been a little spark then? Was there some sort of fuel in the launcher? I remembered the sap in the pine that had caused the tree to explode the night Lysa died.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Before we left, I wanted to examine our weapon. Carefully, I laid out the spike and the quiver in which it fit. The click I had heard came from a tiny mechanism with interlocking teeth like bits on a small disk. I began to move the disk with my talon.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Be careful!” Loki said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Don’t worry, it’s not loaded now. It won’t do anything.” I could see that the secret to its power was a spring that doubled the speed of the thrust. On further examination, I saw that the spike itself had notches interlocked with the launcher. It was a devilishly clever invention.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We knew we had a dangerous item in our talons, but we were determined to take it back to Dark Fowl and show Orf and Thora. We found a second launcher in the botkin and decided we would take two launchers, several spikes, and one metal loop. We would have to fly with the utmost care.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We vowed to come back to the ice cave in the Nacht Sted, but for now we knew we must leave. We had discovered more than we had ever expected, but I still wanted to learn more about the place where the winds were hatched, where the jealous sisters Snurla and Solskynn clashed in the dim mists.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Imagine if Snurla and Solskynn had got hold of these spikes,” Loki mused. “There might not have been a myth after all. They would have killed each other instantly.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Exactly,” I said. But I felt my gizzard wrench. These might not have been weapons for the Others, but for us owls, they could be incredibly deadly. I was almost exultant at the thought that this could end the war once and for all. I began to imagine a life with Lil, a peaceful life. Wingfast! We could be wingfast and all because of these fire spikes!</p>
