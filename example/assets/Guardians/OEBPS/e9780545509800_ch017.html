<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">As we approached the northeast side of the island, we spotted a few of the sisters below us skimming the kelp beds in a small inlet. Others were combing the beach. They wore snoods on the backs of their heads and, falling to their shoulders, a kind of ornamental net woven from the lacy seaweed native to the island. Across their faces, they draped veils of the same seaweed, but with large eye-openings so they could see.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I don’t know how they fly with that stuff hanging all over them,” Lil said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“They probably wonder how we fly with battle claws,” Moss replied.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Look!” Lil said, flipping her head up. “There’s an honest-to-Glaux smee hole above the cliffs where they have Orf!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I felt a sudden tingle in my gizzard. “If that’s the case, silence!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I gave the wing waggle signal. Although we hadn’t quite mastered the code, I did my best to explain a strategy with it. We would soar on the updrafts of the steam vents directly over the cave and listen in on the Ice Talon operatives. Steam, like water and air, transmits sound beautifully. Despite my far-from-perfect signaling, the other three owls immediately grasped what I was saying. So we swooped into the smee hole and soon could pick up the voices of the duplicitous owls of the Ice Talons League.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Skellig’s voice gave us a shock. He sounded older, more mature, and spoke with a clipped assurance. The Great Horned was no cadet, but a seasoned commander. Great Glaux, my gizzard swelled with loathing for him.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I think he’s coming around,” Skellig said. “I put just enough powder in his cup to get him here. Maybe we can get something out of him.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Orf didn’t sound like himself, either. He was decidedly groggy but alive — his heart was definitely beating. I could see the relief in everyone’s eyes. Still, Skellig’s words made my gizzard flinch — <span class="italic">We can get something out of him.</span> He must mean the formula for cold coals. And if they got it out of him, would they kill him? We had thought they were going to capture Orf and bring him to their armory to begin forging. But it sounded as if they only wanted the formula.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">But what assurance did they have that Orf would give them the real formula? Had Skellig learned enough in his observations to be able to discern the real one from a fake?</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“We’ll get him to that abandoned forge on the far side of Stormfast,” one of the Eagle Owls said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">At this, I thought Thora was going to go kerplonken. Her forge, her secret forge! Once there, they would test the formula, and if it worked, they would kill Orf. If it didn’t, they would torture him until he gave them the right formula.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We had to get out of the smee-hole draft. We had to talk and not be heard. I gave a slight wing tap to Moss, who was flying next to me, and made a quick exit. The others followed. We roosted up on the west side of Elsemere, downwind of the cave. They couldn’t hear us.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“We have to act fast,” Thora said. “I’ll bet you anything they pilfered cold coals from someone, if not Orf then another smith of Dark Fowl. Skellig himself probably did it.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I thought of that moleskin pouch that Thora had told us about in which Skellig had carried the powders to drug Orf. He could have used one just like it to carry cold coals. They might have withered a bit but they could be revived if someone knew what they were doing. “Once Orf has been forced to show them how to forge a weapon with cold coals, they’ll kill him on the spot. We have to think of something,” I said. Everyone was listening to me except for Lil, who was looking off toward the beach below where we were perched. She had begun to peel off her battle claws.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What are you doing?” Thora asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I have an idea. You and me, Thora, we have to get down to that beach and get some seaweed.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Whatever for?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“We’re sisters.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Huh?” Thora said. Moss and I blinked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Glauxian Sisters! We’re going to make ourselves some snoods and veils and take vows of silence, except to give succor to the wounded. And there’s one other rule here — nonviolence. But not us! We’re going to be deadly — the deadliest sisters on this island.”</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">“Hellooooo!” Lil trilled in the sweet tones of a very elderly owl. “Sister Alymisia here.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“And Sister Pollifer!” Thora added. “We believe you have a wounded soldier with you?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Everything’s fine,” one of the Eagle Owls replied.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh! We thought we saw a vacuum transport?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It’s nothing to worry about,” Skellig said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No, we’re doing quite fine in here,” said another of the Eagle Owls, poking his head out of the cave. He was unclawed and his bare talons showed.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">An agonizing cry of pain punctured the air.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, dear!” Lil exclaimed in a hoarse voice. “That doesn’t sound fine to me. Does it, Sister Pollifer?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">She gave a slight nod, and the two owls charged into the cave. Before the Skellig and the Eagle Owls knew what had happened, Lil had drawn out Miss Hot Point, her hot lance, and hurled it. The lance pierced Skellig’s starboard wing.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Let me finish the damage done by the nest-maid snake! Or was it a siege blade?” Lil screeched. The pile of feathers that was Orf sprang to life. He seized a pair of battle claws that lay discarded and lashed out at an Eagle Owl, raking its eyes from its face. Thora jousted with a half scimitar of her own design.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Moss and I flew into the cave, both of us armed with ice. The one Eagle Owl, now blinded, was no longer in contention, but there were still three more Eagle Owls. One fully clawed, one half clawed, and one bare taloned. We needed to get them into the air where we could fight better and where we would have the advantage because they didn’t have any weapons. Or so we thought, until the half-clawed eagle produced a flail and began whirling it overhead. He was aiming at Lil, who was trying to retrieve Miss Hot Point from Skellig’s shattered and bloody wing.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Lil, leave it!” I shouted. She ducked just in time. The flail swung by her and hit a target all right — Skellig! It split his skull neatly in half. Orf stepped up and extricated the flail from the bloody pulp of what had been Skellig’s head.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“All right, you contemptible old grotter, you!” Orf swung the flail with an ease and grace unlike anything I had ever seen. He was vastly superior to any of our instructors. Of course, Orf had designed the weapon and knew it like no other owl. The Eagle Owls beat a hasty retreat, streaking out of the cave. And that was where the real surprise happened.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">In the vanishing light of the day, as the sky became tinged with what owls call First Lavender, two owls emerged out of the clouds — one huge and the other tiny. It was Loki and Blix, the Great Gray and the Northern Saw-whet. I saw something slice through the air like the tail of an infinitesimally small comet. There was a spurt of very red blood, heart’s blood, and one of the Eagle Owls plummeted. What aim! Another comet flew by, thrown by Blix almost immediately after the first.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Great Glaux!</span> I thought. Loki and Blix were doing exactly what I had imagined. A midair reload! Loki was carrying a quiver of ice splinters, and Blix launched them one after another. We began to fight with renewed vigor. This was not a squadron, not a platoon, nor even a brigade, but exactly what I dreamed of — a hyper-maneuverable unit of owls of mixed sizes who were all fighting at the knife edge of our skills. The battle was over as fast as it had begun.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Fetch up! Fetch up!” Orf shouted, and we flew to the roosting place where we had originally planned out the assault.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I was breathless not just from the combat, but from the overwhelming surprise of Loki and Blix’s arrival.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Where — where did you come from?” I stammered. We were all shocked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Loki explained. “Orf was discovered missing just after midday. Then you four and Skellig …”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“By the way, where is Skellig?” Blix asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Dead.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, dear!” Blix gasped.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Don’t waste your tears,” Lil said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Blix grimaced. “It looked like he might have been in on this. Someone said they saw him snitch cold coals. But when you four turned up missing, too — they were ready to blame you as well.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Us!” Thora said indignantly.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Especially you, Thora. They said you were always hanging around Orf’s forge,” Loki added.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Well, she was!” Orf explained. “Don’t blame Thora. If it hadn’t been for Thora …” Orf’s voice dwindled as if he couldn’t contemplate the fate he had escaped.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“If it hadn’t been for Thora, none of us would be here,” I cut in. “But how did you and Loki ever find us?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“One of the gadfeathers — I don’t think those owls ever sleep — she said she thought she saw the four of you fly off. Loki and I were so upset. They’re going to de-comm you from the Academy!”</p>
