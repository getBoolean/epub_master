<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">I have to admit that I found Skellig’s apology, well — touching, for lack of a better word. And sincere. Apparently, Thora was not so quick to forgive. She returned to the barracks after our twixt-time repast, troubled not just so much by Skellig’s harsh words, but by the wound beneath his starboard wing. It was not a wound made by snake fangs. Of this, she told me later, she was certain. The puckered skin bore all the marks of a siege blade, one of the most difficult of all blades to forge. Where would a young owl like Skellig have encountered such a blade? He was a cadet. He had seen no action.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">When Cadet Skellig snuck out in late morning to the grog trees, Thora decided to follow him. She would be discreet and lag a good way behind him. There were some puffy clouds overhead that would provide camouflage for her if necessary. She knew Skellig was not a particularly skillful flier, so she had no fear of keeping up with him. But Thora blinked, because as soon as Skellig was out of the barracks, he went into a beautiful, steep banking turn and headed for the isolated cliffs at the far end of Dark Fowl, a place known for its tumultuous winds. He laid on the speed, negotiating the turbulence with a grace she had never seen before from him.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Thora began to feel a kind of blackening dread in her gizzard. Cumulus clouds were building up just south of the point, and she decided to bury herself in them and listen. Skellig’s flying was still not as silent as most, perhaps because of his wound, so she could track him fairly easily. Soon, she picked up another sound, quite distinct. From the whisper of the wind passing over its plummels,<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn20" id="fn20"><span class="superscript">20</span></a> she could tell there was a Pygmy Owl in the cloud bank as well. She heard a faint churr when the two of them met up, and then the Pygmy turned and flew straight out to sea. Cadet Skellig curved around on a flight path, Thora guessed, toward the grog tree favored by Orf. Listening carefully, Thora could tell that there was something different in Cadet Skellig’s flight. He was flying heavier. Was he carrying a weapon? But no. It didn’t sound that heavy. A botkin of some sort? Thora tipped her head and contracted her facial disc to home in on the sound.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">From the way the wind whistled against it, Thora could tell the object Skellig was carrying was not made from metal. It seemed instead to be made from something soft and slightly furry. Moleskins were often used by field medics for transporting powders and unguents for wounds. It must be a moleskin. But if Cadet Skellig needed medicine for his wound, which looked well healed, why wouldn’t he just go to the Academy infirmary?</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">All this was becoming more and more mysterious, and Thora was determined to find out what was happening. It was still quite early. Owls tended to rest up a bit before hitting the grog trees, and Orf in particular had quite a bit of work to do to dampen his forge at the end of the night. He was meticulous about his tools, and he always started a load of cold coals braising in the moss-lined ice cubbies before he left.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Thora hid herself in the snow-laden boughs of a bushy spruce tree and watched Skellig landing in the grog tree a short distance away. As she suspected, the grog tree wasn’t open for business yet. Tin cups hung on the pegs unattended. Each smith had their own cup with their mark inscribed on it. Thora watched carefully as Skellig approached the branch with the cups, but couldn’t see what he was doing. Something didn’t feel right to her, not at all.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The grog keeper finally appeared.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Well, ain’t you the early bird, Cadet!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I like to be here when the troops arrive,” Skellig said. “I learn more from them than I do in any class.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Probably right. Now what’ll it be, bingle or bangle?”<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn21" id="fn21"><span class="superscript">21</span></a></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, bangle. Like to be able to think straight, you know.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Got a lot to think about, eh?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Skellig suddenly looked a bit nervous, as if he had said too much. “Not really. But I like to be alert for the stories.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Here you go.” The grog keeper set out a cup of bangle juice.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">By this time, a few more owls had shown up. There were two smiths from down island and then three battle-weary Burrowing Owls back from the front, one with a patch over his eye.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“A double-strength bingle shot will help you with that,” the keeper said, nodding at the owl with the eye patch.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Two enormous Eagle Owls arrived and perched a bit away from the others. Skellig looked around as if expecting someone, but seemed to assiduously avoid the gaze of the Eagle Owls.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Hail, Orf,” the keeper hooted, and a hooray went up in the tree.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Here at last!” said a Barn Owl, though one might not have guessed his species, for his white, heart-shaped face was so streaked with soot it looked nearly black.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I was wrestling with cold fire and cold coals. Takes a while but it’s the season, as you know,” Orf offered.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You braising already?” the Barn owl asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Ayuh, the best time is when the weather starts to change. The dampness locks in the chill.” He sighed and leaned forward on his perch toward the keep. “Gimme a bingle with a touch of bangle, Jobee. Need to start off with a bit of the soft stuff.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Coming right up, sir.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Thora couldn’t take her eyes off Orf. She worshipped the smith. In her mind, he was more than a blacksmith, more than a weapons monger. He was an artist. Everything he did seemed artistic to Thora — the way he wielded his hammer, the way he held his tongs. Even the way he sipped his juice was special, interesting.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">It wasn’t long before the grog tree was crowded. A gadfeather arrived and began to sing a bawdy song:</p>
<div class="extract">

<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">We’ll start all over again.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The songs got bawdier with “Tickle Me Tail Feathers.” Then romantic — “Got a Lot of Love in This Old Gizzard.” Then the owls sang a rousing fight song:</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">Hail, hail, warriors valiant,</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">We’ll conquer them yet.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">With our banners flying,</span></p>

<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">And never bend.</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;"><span class="italic">Now let’s raise a cup!</span></p>
</div>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Thora saw Orf lift a talon to his brow as if he were tired or perhaps suffering from a headache. She was downwind of the tree slightly and tipped her head so she could better pick up what he was saying to the keeper.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Feeling poorly, Orf?” the keeper asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“A bit of a headache. Often happens this time a year when I’m braising the cold coals. The fumes, you know. Think I’ll be toddling off.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">It looked more like toddling to Thora than actual flying. Orf flew only a short distance before settling down and trying to get lift again. Thora noticed that he was heading in the opposite direction of his forge, as if he was completely disoriented. She was about to fly out from her spot in the boughs of the fir tree to see if he needed help, when she saw that the two Eagle Owls had flipped their heads around and were following Orf’s progress. There was a lot of boisterous singing and tumult in the tree by this time, and no one noticed the Eagle Owls leave with Skellig.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Thora felt dread building in her gizzard. She knew that Orf was in danger but the two immense Eagle Owls were not birds to trifle with. They were at least twice her size and three times her wingspan. <span class="italic">The perfect wingspan for … Oh, great Glaux!</span> It suddenly dawned on her. They were planning a transport vacuum!<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn22" id="fn22"><span class="superscript">22</span></a></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Two more Eagle Owls materialized out of a heavily boughed fir tree just like the one she had been hiding in. Should she scream? Sound an alarm? The owls in the grog tree were too far into the bingle juice to do anything. Should she go back and fetch the others, Lyze, Moss? It was too far and in the opposite direction. Orf would be gone by then.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Thora made a quick decision — she would have to track the Eagle Owls. When she knew where they had taken Orf, she could report back and get help. She was sure they would not kill Orf; his knowledge was too valuable. His cold coals and the ice weapons were superior to anything existing in the Northern Kingdoms. Those weapons alone were responsible for more deaths on the battlefield than any others. Of course the Ice Talons League wanted Orf! They would force him to make his cold weapons and the hot ones as well — the fizblisters, the flails, the ice daggers.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Then it struck Thora. All the times she went to observe Orf working at his forge, who was always there? Cadet Skellig! And this wasn’t the first time she had seen Skellig at a grog tree favored by Orf. She had assumed that Skellig was interested in smithing, just like herself. But she remembered Skellig questioning Orf carefully about when the season for the cold coals would start. Now she knew it was because Skellig wanted to know when to nab him. Skellig must have put a potion in Orf’s cup. That accounted for Orf’s staggering flight from the grog tree. It was no headache from braising cold coals. They had drugged him!</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The weather had turned dirty. Clouds rolled in from the north, and the day darkened. There was a mixture of snow, sleet, and hail — perfect weather for making cold coals. The dense cloud cover provided good camouflage for Thora, but she began to worry. She could clearly hear the Eagle Owls talking, but the sound of Orf’s breathing, his heart, and the gurgles of his gizzard were growing dimmer and dimmer. Had they given him too much of the drug? Was Orf dying?</p>
