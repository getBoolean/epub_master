<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">That, dear readers, is exactly what happened. Blind Octavia led me back to books, to science, to research, and rekindled the dwindling flames of my mind. My steadfast friend Octavia stirred the coals that were quickly becoming cinders — the cinders that would have led to complete dementia. Soon, she was much more than a nest-maid snake. She was my research assistant and, with her odd bumpy writing, my note taker. The sound of her fangs puncturing parchment was a new kind of music, one that seemed to blend with the lovely hymns of evensong and the wind shivering through the trees.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Some creatures have a destiny thrust upon them that is at odds with their true nature. War and leadership had been thrust on me by my parents, by the times, and by the spreading bile of Bylyric’s evil. Left to my own, I wanted nothing to do with war. I only wanted to explore the mysteries of our Earth and its creatures. Science was my great love, but the ferschtucken War of the Ice Talons kept getting in the way.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">It was at the Glauxian Brothers retreat — a place where faith was as much a part of life as air — that I made some of my most significant scientific discoveries. I observed, tested, and proved certain notions that I had speculated on for years.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">When the war died down, I went to the hatching place of the winds again and again, always accompanied by Octavia. Some of my ideas I had to discard, but others I managed to prove.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I have no problem with the stories or legends my fellow owls seemed to love. I had no problem with the Glauxian Brothers’ deep faith. Faith is a personal thing after all. None of the Brothers would force their faith upon me. They simply choose to picture the world in a different way. As Brother Oliver said to me once, “There’s room for both, you know. There’s more than one way to tell a story.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The War of the Ice Claws did eventually come to an end, but none too soon. Bylyric’s son, Jesper, rose to prominence, inheriting the raging remnants of his father’s force. But a Glauxspeed assassination unit led by Strix Struma, Loki, and Blix cornered him in a remote region of the H’rathghar. And it was Patches, the snow leopard I’d injured, who actually delivered the fatal blow to him with one of her immense paws.<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn36" id="fn36"><span class="superscript">36</span></a></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I never learned what happened to Ifghar. Never asked and no one ever told me. It was better that way. I had to put him out of my mind and out of my life, or bitterness would consume me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Long before the end of the war, news came to me that Thora had decamped and flown to the Southern Kingdoms. She wanted to create art, not weapons. Like me, she was done with war.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Every now and then, Loki or Blix or Moss would show up at the retreat and try to entice me to return to Dark Fowl as an instructor. But I had no interest. I was completely occupied with my research, and the Glauxian Brothers library was a Glauxsend for me.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">One day, I heard a whispering outside my hollow.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I’ll see,” I heard Octavia say from just outside the hollow. “But don’t count on it.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Don’t count on what, Octavia?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You have a visitor, Lyze.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Blix and Rufus were here just last moon. I told them then and I’ll tell them again, I have no interest in becoming an instructor.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">A familiar voice broke in. “They’re called rybs at the Great Ga’Hoole Tree, Lyze. Rybs, not instructors.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I nearly dropped my plummels. “Thora!” I exclaimed.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“None other.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“B-b-but I thought you were in the Southern Kingdoms!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Indeed. I have a forge in Silverveil. I make beautiful things, Lyze — sculpture from metal. I haven’t made a weapon in — let’s see, nigh on five years.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">She planted herself before me and glared. “Now listen to me, you stubborn old Whiskered Screech. You’ve grieved too long. Grief becomes an indulgence after a certain point.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I looked at her narrowly. “What are you trying to say?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Come with me! Come back to the Great Ga’hoole Tree. Come be a teacher, a ryb.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I don’t want to teach about war.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You don’t have to. In the Hoolian dialect, ‘ryb’ means ‘learned one.’ You’ve been exploring, researching all these years. Why not share it? There is a library at the great tree that makes this one look pathetic.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Don’t tell Brother Oliver that,” Octavia said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Thora swiveled her head around. “He knows it. Who do you think sent a peregrine to tell me what Lyze has been up to? Octavia can come with you and continue to be your assistant.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I shook my head wearily. “But it’s impossible, Thora. Don’t you understand — they’ll know me. Everyone knows about Major General Lyze of Kiel, creator of the Glauxspeed Division. The division that won the War of the Ice Claws.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No!” said another voice. Brother Oliver crammed into the hollow.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You won’t be known as Major General Lyze of Kiel.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Well, what in the name of Glaux would I be known as?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Ezylryb,” Brother Oliver said softly. “Ezylryb! And you will become the greatest ryb the Great Ga’Hoole Tree has ever seen.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I swung my head toward Octavia. Although she couldn’t see me, she had developed extraordinary sensibilities and seemed to know when I was looking at her and what I might say before I said it. But for this no words were really needed. She nodded ever so slightly, and I could see what she was thinking:</p>
