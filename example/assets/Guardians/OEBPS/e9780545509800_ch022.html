<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">If I had pictured a romantic reunion with Lil, I was to be disappointed. When I found her in the eastern barracks where the female cadets were billeted, she was in a small hollow with none other than the distinguished Cadet Strumajen Strix. They were in the thick of a conversation about battle strategy. Lil looked up at me with her bright, gleaming amber eyes and my gizzard twitched. “I was just telling Strix Struma — she likes to be called that — about the rescue of Orf, and our ideas.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The Spotted Owl looked at me, nodded her head very respectfully, and said in a quiet voice, “Brilliant. Just brilliant! If I’d had a mid-flight reload during the attack on Gareth’s Keep … what I could have accomplished.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I understand that you did plenty as it was,” I replied. Strix Struma was much younger than I expected, younger than Lil or me. Obviously, she was some sort of child prodigy, and I liked her immediately. There was a keenness in her gaze, and I liked the set of her feathers.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“So how did it go with the general?” Lil added. “Moss caught me up on things and told me you were with him to discuss a new unit.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Well, yes … uh, the good news is the general really likes my ideas. And we have a name for it. There’s just one little problem. It’s not exactly a unit, Lil. It’s a division. The Glauxspeed Division.”</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">Soon, we were making a list.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“All right,” Strix Struma said. “In the Kielian League, a division is made up of three to five hundred owls. So we begin with that.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Owls,” I said rather vaguely. “That’s a bit limiting.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What do you mean, Lyze?” Lil asked. Strix Struma looked slightly confused as well.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What about snakes?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Snakes?” they both uttered. Bewilderment clouded their eyes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, Kielian snakes.” I began to explain my thoughts about snakes and how they were underutilized.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I like it,” Strix Struma said slowly. “I like it a lot.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I love it!” Lil explained. “Ground troops would certainly give us an edge.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“And that gives me an idea,” Strix Struma said. “Let’s think of other animals that could help us.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Polar bears,” I said. “But they sleep most of the winter so they’d only be available to serve during soffen issen at the earliest and then through ny schnee.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Something flashed through my mind. The mangled talon of Hrenna, Moss’s mother. I turned to Lil and Strix Struma. “Moss’s mother! She leads a commando unit called the Flying Leopards.” It was so still, I could have heard a plummel drop. “Supposing,” I continued, “there were other ground troops linked with the Kielian snakes — a unit of snow leopards.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“They’re pure muscle,” Strix Struma said. “There were several around Little Hoole. They can climb anything — sheer ice cliffs. Their paws are huge. I saw one once knock a polar bear senseless. And they can swim.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We began scratching madly on a birch bark. Moss arrived and we worked through twixt time and on past noon, never taking a break. By First Lavender, we had a rough organization for the Glauxspeed. We had reworked the standard size of a division and its normal subunits. While standard military division sizes were anywhere from three hundred to five hundred owls, our division was a scant three hundred forty animals, composed of two regiments of one hundred owls of mixed species, fifty Kielian snakes, and twenty snow leopards. The division was further broken down into battalions composed of twenty owls, ten snakes, and ten snow leopards each.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Finally, there were the smallest units made up of twelve owls, five snakes, and five leopards each. The unit was what I had first envisioned — a combat group that was light, fast, and flexible, both in the air and on the ground.<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn25" id="fn25"><span class="superscript">25</span></a> And could shatter the very gizzard of the Orphan Maker!</p>
