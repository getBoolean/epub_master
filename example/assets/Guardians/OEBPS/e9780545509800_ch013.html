<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">Moss’s sisters had all survived. Their hollow was not in a pine tree, which had turned out to be a veritable firetrap. My parents returned soon after the tragic attack. They had seen a lot, but never anything quite like this, never an attack on broodies and children. My mother was stunned. She kept hopping around in the charred debris of the tree, as if she were searching for some tiny remnant — a toy, perhaps even an old yarped pellet of Lysa’s — of her youngest chick. My father followed her, and every now and then would pat her with his wing tip and try to murmur soothing words. But there was nothing he could say. The war had changed in a way that no one had ever anticipated. No longer did warrior meet warrior on a neutral field. Bylyric had come to our peaceful forest and savaged it.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The battle in our forest had been won by what my da called a “few good owls.” And he included me in that small coterie. Moss and Thora and I had distinguished ourselves. After all, we were very young owls and had not as yet experienced any kind of combat on this scale, nor had we any kind of combat training. My parents’ devastation at the loss of their first daughter was eased by their pride in me. “A real soldier, this one!” my da would boom. And my mum’s yellow eye would glitter fiercely. “A commando if I ever saw one,” she proclaimed.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">Moss, Thora, and I flew to Dark Fowl soon after the attack. We realized our childhood was finished. I had the feeling that Thora’s had been finished long before. The news of the attack had reverberated throughout the Kielian League and nowhere was it more evident than on Dark Fowl. The island bustled with activity. The smiths did not sleep. Their fires burned both day and night. The honing pits had added snakes, who worked in shifts through the days and nights.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The Military Academy on Dark Fowl gave us no time to grieve. There was so much to learn, and we were busy constantly. With the attack on Stormfast, the war had escalated and we were only the first of many attacks on civilian settlements to come.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">It was not easy for a young owl to arrive for training with a bit of a history behind him. At least, that’s the way it was with the three of us — Moss, Thora, and myself. Everyone had heard about the attack on Stormfast. Expectations were running high for us, uncomfortably high. It was especially tough for Thora, who really had no desire to train as a cadet. She wanted to learn smithing and apprentice Orf. She would settle for an apprenticeship with no other smiths. There had never been a female smith in the history of the Northern Kingdoms; it was not a promising situation. I cringed when she asked one of our instructors once if she might take some training to work at a forge.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“A forge!” the Barn Owl, who was a female, screeched. “Are you yoickers? Females are not smith material, not at all, never ever!” And it was a female squawking at poor Thora! It was shocking to me how rigid the instructors and officers of the Kielian League were. Shocking and disheartening, for none of them seemed to have much imagination. They never entertained the idea that there might be other ways to do things.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The elite commando units were very specialized in the types of raids they implemented and the kinds of weapons they used. I wanted to do it all — sabotage, surveillance, reconnaissance. I was very interested in military strategy in general. Serving in a commando unit, no matter how elite, seemed limiting to me. But cadets couldn’t pick and choose what they wanted to do or what they felt their strengths were. There was a rigid curriculum and any picking and choosing was done by the regimental commander of the Academy. That was a Barred Owl named Optimus Strix Varia.<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn15" id="fn15"><span class="superscript">15</span></a> He was a stern, old owl and, although he was missing three of his four talons on his port foot, he was skillful with fizgigs and fizblisters. These spiked iron spheres on the end of lightweight chains were among the most challenging of weapons to manipulate. Inside the fizblisters were hot coals that made them even more difficult, for if the owl wielding the weapon made the slightest mistake, he could ignite his own feathers. But the fizblisters could be lethal. An attacking owl could swoop into an enemy formation and scatter it with one twirl of the weapon. There was a release mechanism on the chain that had to be operated with great precision, and experts with fizblisters could hurl them great distances. Timing was everything!</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">Moss, Thora, and I settled into our barracks in the outcropping of lithite rocks and began to make friends with our fellow cadets. The most memorable were Blix, a tiny Northern Saw-whet, and Loki, a Great Gray. They had known each other since they were fledglings and made quite a pair, as Blix didn’t even come up to Loki’s knees. But they were fast friends. When I first met them, I could not help but notice that Loki’s wing tips were a bit tattered, as if he had bashed them up somehow. I remember saying, “Looks like you have already seen some combat!” The two friends exchanged almost guilty glances.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, it was nothing,” Loki said quickly. “I just got a scrape on these fresh feathers.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, yes,” I said. I realized it was a source of embarrassment to Loki and I dropped the subject. “That can happen.”</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">What interested me the most about Blix and Loki was that they came from a region in the northernmost reaches of the Bitter Sea, in fact very close to Shagdah Snurl, the coldest and darkest place on Earth. But it was not the Shagdah Snurl that intrigued me. It was the place at its very center called Nacht Sted, where my mother had told me the winds were hatched.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Have you ever seen a wind hatch?” I asked the Great Gray and the Northern Saw-whet.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Of course!” they both said at once. “We have a celebration when the kitibits come,” Blix explained.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Skyboshing?” Thora asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It’s great fun. You ride the backside — the bosh — of a curl wind.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You ride the kitibits?” I asked. I was astounded.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Sure we do,” Blix replied.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“But you’re so tiny,” Thora gasped.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I won’t take offense at that,” the Saw-whet said, and squared her shoulders. “But actually being small makes it easier.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I have a question,” I said slowly. The serious note in my voice caught their attention.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“We’ve been at the Academy for three days and have been told about all sorts of classes and exercises to turn us into skillful warriors, but no one has ever mentioned anything about weather.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What about weather?” Moss asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I mean weather interpretation — analysis. Think how helpful that would be to planning battle strategies.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Well, I don’t mean to brag,” Loki said. “But they say no owl flies better than owls from Shagdah Snurl.” He spread his enormous wings and lofted into flight to begin a series of beautiful curling loops. When he alighted on the ground again, Blix turned to him.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You might not mean to brag, Loki, but that was bragging!” But she said this with good cheer. One could tell that they were used to pulling each other’s feathers.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Are there any instructors, flight instructors, here at the Academy from Shagdah?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“There used to be one, I think,” Blix said thoughtfully. “But she died a long time ago.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“That brings up another question,” Thora snapped. There was an edge to her voice that we hadn’t heard before.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Gotta burr in your plummels?” Moss asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Wrong question</span>, I thought.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, as a matter of fact I do.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What is it?” I asked cautiously.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Blix mentioned a flight instructor. A she. There are several female instructors of note here, I believe. There is a colonel who commands the Frost Beaks. A Pearl-spotted Pygmy, Esa Glaucidum Perlatum. She commands the A unit of the Frost Beaks. I hope I get into A unit because B unit is headed up by Coloniel Stellan Micrathene Whitneyi, who is about as haggish as an Elf Owl ever gets. A nasty piece of work, that one.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What’s your point, Thora?” I asked as gently as possible.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“My point is this! There are several female instructors and commanders. Your own mother, Lyze, heads up the Ice Dagger unit and was an instructor here at the Academy before that. But there is not one blacksmith on the island of Dark Fowl who is female, not one Rogue smith in the entire Northern Kingdoms who is female. I have no interest in fighting, in becoming a warrior serving in some elite commando unit. But I do have a great interest in learning how to smith the weapons these units employ in battle. When I mentioned that I wanted to study smithing and serve as an apprentice to Orf, the regimental commander nearly lost his gizzard!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“He did?” I asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, he did.” She paused as if to remember. “I really think I almost killed him when I said that.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The others were finding this entire story rather humorous, but I began to think about it.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I think,” Thora continued reflectively, “that the Academy has a rather narrow view of things. I mean, as Blix and Loki mentioned, the best fliers come from the Shagdah Snurl but none of the flight instructors are from there. And think about the rocks that melt in the volcanoes, the flames that must make those rocks melt. What kind of coals might they produce for a smith’s forge? Ice weapons from the Dagger are said to be superior to any that are harvested from the Shag, but maybe the harvesters are looking for the wrong kind of ice? It seems to me that we should be sending owls to research up there.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“My mum lost her eye to an ice splinter,” I said. “But my father said it was crudely honed. They thought it was inferior ice from up around the Shag. But I’m beginning to wonder if it was inferior or if they don’t know how to make a proper cold coal with those coals from the volcano up there at the Nacht Sted.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Precisely,” Thora said. “If someone knew how to use those coals properly, well, it could be very dangerous for the Kielian League.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You know what?” Blix often began her comments this way. She was a very reflective owl.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What?” Thora asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Well,” Blix said, “with your interest in coals, and Lyze’s in weather, you should come up to the Shagdah Snurl for the holidays.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Could we?” I said excitedly. I could think of nothing better. What was home for me now anyway? The charred remains of the slender pine. The memory of Lysa. As far as I knew, Mum and Da were back at the front already. They usually were in the summer months. It would be a dream come true for me to go to the place where the winds hatch. I felt it might be a place of inspiration.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">This war would never end unless some new ideas were born. But who would listen to a bunch of young owls like ourselves? The more I thought about it, the more ideas I had. A delegation should be sent to Shagdah to recruit great fliers and study the winds. Smiths should be sent to the volcanoes to examine the coals. Some should be sent to the land called the Beyond to see how the colliers retrieved coals from the ember beds of the Sacred Volcanoes there. If Bylyric had turned into an Orphan Maker, and the front was coming closer every night, there wasn’t much time before the Kielian League would be overrun. Already, there were rumors that our class would be fast-tracked to graduate early and head immediately out to the front.</p>
