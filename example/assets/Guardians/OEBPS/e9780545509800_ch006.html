<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">“Well, I’ll be … I’ll be,” my da kept muttering as we flew back in the breaking light of the dawn. It was a beautiful flight — the sky was tinted with an earthly pink and, just above, a soft blue began to show. Was it azure? Cerulean? Cyan? Then a low mist started to roll across the choppy waters of the Everwinter Sea.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What is that?” I asked my father, nodding down at the water.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Sea smoke.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Sea smoke? Is there a fire someplace?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No, lad. Some call it ‘sea steam.’”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What causes it?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Ah, you’re a curious one, aren’t you, lad? I like that. Well, it’s caused when very cold air moves in over warmer water. The water on the surface begins to evaporate and that’s about all I can tell you.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">That was enough to get me thinking. “Da, can I fly down there and skim the surface? I want to see this sea smoke close up.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“As long as you don’t get lost in it. You be careful. If it starts to close in on you, fly back up here right away.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My father was a bit anxious, but he was not one to stand in the way of a young and inquiring mind. So I began a steeply banking turn. I could almost feel his eyes boring into me. I was careful to angle my wings just so, in what I felt was the stylish manner that he and Mum did when they made a steep descent to our tree. Until that moment, I thought this wing tilt was dashing, but now I realized that it was very useful for sensing the different layers of air.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Just above the sea smoke, the layer of air was cool, but closer to the water, it was much warmer. Odd, I had never thought of the Everwinter Sea as feeling warm. But I realized that it was warm only in comparison to the cold air sweeping down from the north. <span class="italic">That must be glacier air</span>, I thought. The droplets of moisture in the sea smoke were large and I was becoming quite damp. My primaries were growing heavier with the accumulated moisture. <span class="italic">Well</span>, I thought, <span class="italic">I’ll just have to stroke a little bit harder</span>. I felt a twinge in my gizzard as I realized that visibility was shutting down. Just then, I heard the sonorous alarm call of my da. I had done exactly what he said not to do, gotten lost in the sea smoke.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Fear was quickly getting the best of me. I felt it flood through my hollow bones. Something peculiar was happening to my primaries. <span class="italic">Oh, no. Kerplonken! I’m going kerplonken. Just fledged, first real flight, and I go kerplonken</span>.<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn7" id="fn7"><span class="superscript">7</span></a> The sea smoke was swirling all around me. Which way was up? Which way was down? If I didn’t do something soon, I’d hit the water’s surface and drown.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Then it occurred to me; up had to be drier because the air above the sea smoke would be drier than the air closest to the sea. My da’s words came back to me: <span class="italic">Very cold air moves in over warmer water. The water on the surface begins to evaporate.</span> So the air would not only be drier, but colder. If I couldn’t see, I must feel my way back to safety. I stuck a talon straight out in one direction and the other in the opposite. My starboard talon felt slightly drier. I power-flapped both wings. The tips of my primaries were gripping the chill air. To tell you the truth, I didn’t know if I was flying or clawing my way out of the sea smoke, but somehow I made it.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My father emitted a long, low hoot — a hoot of both relief and anguish. He grabbed me by his talons and yanked me up higher.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I can fly, Da. I can fly now. I’m all right.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I know you’re all right, lad, I know it. And Glaux knows you can fly. Never seen anything like it. You were clambering out of that sea smoke as if you were half owl and half … half … I don’t know! A snow leopard scaling the highest peaks of the H’rathghar glacier. Let’s go home now.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My father paused for a moment, an odd expression crossing his face.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“And, Lyze,” he added, “let’s keep this little adventure between the two of us. Don’t mention anything to your mum. It’s not a good time to upset her.”</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">We did not get home until well after twixt time. But as soon as we entered the hollow, I knew something was different. One could just feel it. Da twitched a wing tip to signal me to be quiet and then nodded and led me over to where Mum was settled on a tumble of rabbit’s ear moss and peels of birch bark. It sort of looked like a nest, but not quite. There was more down poking out from the sides.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Why is Mum sleeping there? What is that thing?” I asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Da churred softly. “How quickly you forget.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Forget what?” Slowly, the pellet dropped, as the expression goes. This wasn’t just any nest. It was an egg nest, a brooding nest. Mum had laid an egg.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“C’mon. Crouch down a bit, and we might be able to get a glimpse of it.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I crouched down next to Da, full of all sorts of excited little feelings. My gizzard was hopping around like a bark beetle. I saw just a bit of something white — creamy white. <span class="italic">That must be it!</span> I thought. <span class="italic">My little brother … or sister.</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Does it have wings yet? A beak? Legs?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Give it time, lad. It’s got a lot of growing to do.”</p>
