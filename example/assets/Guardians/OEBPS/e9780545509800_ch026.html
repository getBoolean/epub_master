<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">The Shagdah Snurl and what I thought of as its core, the Nacht Sted, were known as the hatching place of the winds. But I knew we weren’t flying toward a nest tucked up with rabbit’s ear moss. It would be hard to imagine a plump broody clucking encouragingly in this desolate stretch of land. No, instead, it felt as if we were flying toward a boiling cauldron presided over by one of the legendary hagsfiends from the past, with wings dripping ragged black feathers.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">None of these notions seemed to afflict Blix or Loki. The Shagdah was home, sweet home for them! My first task was to disentangle myth and legend from truth and reality. The flight required two whole nights, taking us so far north that the sun barely rose. We were going from night to night, so to speak, with only the smallest splinter of light to crack twixt from tween time. Blix and Loki knew instinctively what time it was, without needing the sun as a marker. And these two owls, the Great Gray and the Northern Saw-whet, could fly rambunctious winds the likes of which I’d never seen before.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I had just recovered from a hard bounce off the leading edge of a rogue airfoil. “Great Glaux!” I exclaimed. “These are real Snurls, aren’t they?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Sorry, Lyze, but they’re not,” Loki replied, rolling easily off a similar foil. “These are just the pre-Snurls.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Watch me,” said Blix. “I am going for the top of that airfoil you see curling above that cloud. You see those threads of turbulence on its lower edge?” Owls can’t see wind precisely, but we can feel the threads of it brushing our filoplumes, as we call those very fine feathers on our faces. “Well,” continued Blix, “we call those threads baggywrinkles. Watch me climb them and catch a ride on the crest of that airfoil.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The tiny owl did a sort of scooter scooch up through the baggywrinkles and zipped through the air above the foil. The way she moved was what inspired my studies of airfoil structure.”<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn29" id="fn29"><span class="superscript">29</span></a></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Soon I saw Loki go into a steep, banking turn. I guessed we were approaching his hollow, although there were almost no trees in this region, save for the occasional thin patch of northern birch. The owls of the Shag, as the natives called it, lived in ice-clad lava cliffs.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">A low pitch warbled across a vast field of jagged dark rocks tipped in ice. <span class="italic">“Whooooo … Whoooo …”</span> It was the unmistakable call of a Great Gray. “Loki!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Mum!” Loki <span class="italic">whooo</span>ed back.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">A Great Gray flew out of a cleft in the cliff to greet us. One of her wings was bent, which gave an odd slant to her flight. “Dear lad! My dear, dear lad!” she cried. “And darling Blix!” Introductions were made and we were led into Wynnifryd’s hollow. A kinder, lovelier Great Gray I have never met.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I just put a naked rockmunk on the coals for myself,” she said. “But, Loki dear, why don’t you go out and fetch some more? There’s a mess of them scrambling around on the rock where you used to take off to play scooter scooch.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Naked rockmunk!” I repeated. “I never heard of such a thing.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“They’re native to the Shag, Lyze. New tastes here, you know.” This was quite the understatement. I had never tasted cooked meat before. When Loki returned with three more of the rockmunks, Wynnifryd slapped them on a bed of coals from the shores of the lava lake.<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn30" id="fn30"><span class="superscript">30</span></a></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You didn’t by any chance see a peregrine, darling, did you?” she asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No, Mum. Why would there be a peregrine around here?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“My question exactly. This is the most unpopulated place on Earth, especially lately.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes,” I replied. “The front has moved far from here.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I don’t go out much, you know,” she said. “Lots of my old friends have died. There are still a few families around with young’uns serving. Probably grandchildren if anything. We are not a young crowd up here.” She paused. “We’re not a crowd at all. That’s why I like it!” she added brightly.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Loki’s mum had been injured, and her mate killed in the Battle of Firthgot. For a time after, she served as a quartermaster in charge of weapons inventory and delivery systems to the field. She was especially interested in our ideas for midair reloads.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I am so, so proud of you, lad!” she said, her voice breaking. “Oh, Loki! The major would have been so proud of you had he lived.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The naked rockmunks were simply delicious, so succulent. They were called “naked” because they had no fur whatsoever. They didn’t need it, because they lived in the warm tunnels on the rim of the lava lake.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We stayed with Loki’s mum for a few days and I explored a variety of steam vents, smee holes, and layers of thermal air around the area. It was as if the landscape was constantly shrouded in sea smoke, except there was no sea around. The whole landscape was covered in rock that had melted eons ago and solidified.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">As fascinated as I was by the Shag, I really wanted to get to the Nacht Sted, the coldest and most desolate place on Earth. There was a volcano with a lava lake there surrounded by several ice caves, and these caves fascinated me the most. This was the safe season to visit, according to Blix and Loki, because the volcano was quiet and not hurling lava bombs into the sky.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">I was terribly excited as we approached the Nacht Sted. We flew over a long-dormant volcano, its crater like a charred crown rimmed in silver frost. I could feel an acute drop in temperature.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I wanted to know how ice could form so close to fire. Would this ice have special qualities that we could use in some way? I dreamed of an entire new arsenal of equipment that we might unleash on Bylyric.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The winds were ferocious, and the ice that fringed the cave entrances was scalloped by the constant onslaught from these gusts.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Wind sculpting,” Blix explained. When I looked across the top of the craters, I could spy the northernmost reaches of the Bitter Sea, a cold, cold sea choked with ice.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“We want to show you something before you start your studies,” Blix said in a somewhat ominous voice.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Are you sure, Blix?” Loki asked. There was a flash of apprehension in his yellow eyes.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I was immediately burning to see what Blix wanted to show me. Burning, that is, as much as one could burn in a place like this.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It’s going to give you the creelies,” Loki warned. “I mean, you’re going to wilf. The first time I saw it, well, I wilfed so much that I was almost as small as Blix.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Just take me there!” I screeched in frustration, though it was hard to screech above the wind.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“All right, all right already!” Loki said, and spread his wings.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">We entered an ice cave on the north side of the extinct volcano. The opening was not much more than a slot, and Loki had to tilt his immense wings at a sharp angle to pass through.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“This slot wasn’t always here,” Loki said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It opened up the summer before we went to the Academy,” Blix explained. “It was even smaller then. It was a really tight fit for Loki.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;"><span class="italic">Aha!</span> I thought, remembering how bashed Loki’s wing tips had been when I first met him, and his lame excuse about molting.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Follow me,” Blix said. “I know the way.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">We followed a long, winding tunnel, flying in some places and walking when the ceilings got too low. The slot began to enlarge eventually, and we came into a spacious cavern. The air was very still and we couldn’t even hear the wind howling outside. There was barely any light. I was so curious, I could almost feel my pupils enlarging.<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn31" id="fn31"><span class="superscript">31</span></a> Then I saw it. Something white hanging from a spike of ice in the distance.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What is it?” I whispered.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“A face,” Loki said, his voice trembling.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“A face of what?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Of an Other …”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My heart skipped a beat. This truly was the place where myth and legend collided.</p>
