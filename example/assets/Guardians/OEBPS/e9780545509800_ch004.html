<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">My father suggested that we accept the invitation to visit Moss’s hollow since his mum had returned now. All returning warriors liked to exchange news from the front. Mum asked me if I wanted to join them.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Is Moss going to be there?” I asked. I really didn’t relish watching him brag about all his accomplishments.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Well, yes, of course, dear.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Isn’t it high time he flew off to Dark Fowl? I mean, he did all the steps. Proved himself,” I said rather dismissively, perhaps without gravitas, the dignity required when speaking of such things. My mother cocked her head and made no attempt to adjust the bandanna that had slipped with this sudden motion.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Lyze, I’m not sure what your problem is here. But I don’t like your attitude. We’re invited over, and you are coming. Fledgling jealousy is an unbecoming trait.” She paused. “Some say it can even make your barbules grow crisscross.” That, I was sure, was an old wives’ tale. On every flight feather there are tiny, nearly invisible hooks called barbules that interlock to produce an even surface over which wind can glide. A favorite scolding for young owlets was “Don’t do that or your barbules will come out ‘whiffy skew.’”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Mum squared her shoulders and gave me a harsh glare with her one eye. “You shall be coming with us. You shall congratulate Moss on his magnificent flight, and you shall behave yourself in a manner that becomes the son of the supreme commander of all the allied forces of the Kielian League, and the commando of the Ice Dagger unit. Is this understood?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I lifted my starboard talon and gave what I hoped was a crisp salute even though I was shaking terribly. Neither my mother nor my father had ever spoken to me this way. I felt a terrible crinkle in my gizzard, and I tried to avoid my mother’s gaze, but she thrust herself toward me and shoved her face so close to mine that her feathers swept my cheek. She cocked her head so that terrible, scarred pit where her eye had been filled my vision. It loomed like a burnt crater.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Take a good look, my dear. You want a perfect mother, do you? One that is not scarred. You know what did that?” I remained silent. She took a deep breath. “You know what took my eye?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No, Mum.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“An ice splinter. And an inferior one at that. I flew right into it. Never saw it coming. Had I not been flying at fever speed, the damage wouldn’t have been so bad. But it was, and now you have a flawed, imperfect mother.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Flawed in body,” my father added. “But not in spirit. Not in valor.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Is … is being a soldier … the … the only … uh … way one can fight?” I asked. My parents blinked at me. Their large yellow eyes seemed to dull with incomprehension. I might as well have been speaking a foreign language.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What in the name of Glaux are you talking about, son?” Da asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Uh … uh … nothing. Forget it.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes.” Mum nodded emphatically. “Forget it!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I looked down at a bark worm that was creeping across the hollow floor. I felt lower than that creeping, spineless, soft-bodied piece of squish that the nest-maid snakes feasted on.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">My mother spotted it as well. “Where is that new nest-maid snake? What’s her name?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Gilda?” I ventured.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, that’s the one. She’s not as good as Mrs. Grinkle. I can’t wait until Mrs. Grinkle gets back from visiting her relatives. Gilda!” she called out.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, ma’am, yes!” Gilda slithered in and gave a salute much crisper than mine, which, considering she was a snake, was rather impressive. “Sorry. Just out. Another Snowy from the tree across just took flight and is heading toward the Point. Guess young Moss has set a new standard.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Would this never stop? Everyone except yours truly here seemed to be progressing in the speediest manner — fever speed! — toward true flight and Dark Fowl Island. And now most frustrating of all, we were off to visit Moss’s hollow. The new local hero in flight accomplishments. I would probably make a mess of even this brief flight, which, truth be told, wasn’t more than extended branching.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Mum and Da went out on a brief hunting foray. They said it was gracious when visiting neighbors to bring a rodent. I could hear Gilda’s swishings as she slithered about, swiping up vermin with her forked tongue and neatening the hollow. I watched as Mum and Da lofted themselves onto a gust. Wings spread, they carved tight elegant turns until they were over the crowns of the trees that made up our small grove. They angled their wings so the tips seemed to brush the sky. <span class="italic">I envy them; if I could only fly so beautifully.</span></p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“So do I,” a voice behind me spoke softly.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Gilda!” I wheeled about, nearly losing my balance on the rim of the hollow. I thought the words were in my head, but I must have whispered them aloud.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes. Your parents are beautiful fliers. It stirs me deeply.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I blinked. Gilda had twisted herself into a neat coil and had been peering over my shoulder out into the night, tracking my parents’ flight.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“But how can you envy them? You’re a snake.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I know. Odd, isn’t it? But I can just imagine what it might feel like to fly.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You can?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes,” she answered with a wistfulness to her voice as she gazed out the hollow.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I looked at her as she slithered off. Something struck me about this snake. Mrs. Grinkle was nice, but Gilda was much more interesting. I was drawn to her from the time she first arrived, for some reason. I think it was her stories — she told the best twixt-time stories as the dawn came and I was supposed to be settling down to sleep. But now I knew what it really was that captivated me. It was her imagination. Any snake who could imagine flying had to be special in some way. That’s probably why Gilda wasn’t a very good nest-maid. She thought deeply and didn’t pay attention to bark worms and wood beetles and such.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I followed Gilda back into the deepest part of the hollow, where she was wrestling with a small nest of thread worms.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What’cha want, dearie?” She turned around.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I just blurted it out. “I’m scared that I’ll make a mess of landing on that branch outside of Moss’s hollow and everyone will laugh at me. Everyone flies so much better than I do.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, nonsense, Lyze. You’ll do just fine.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No, I won’t!”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“You won’t if you say you won’t. You must believe you will, lad.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“But how can I believe I will if I am … am … am …”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Not sure?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes. Not sure. How do you believe if you’re not sure?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Now that is a good question. Some creatures say faith is believing what you cannot see or prove. But I believe that faith is the power to imagine. If you can imagine the feel of the air beneath your wings, if you can picture in your mind’s eye your plummels<a href="e9780545509800_fnote001.html#rfn4" id="fn4"><span class="superscript">4</span></a> brushing the sounds from the night and quieting your passage, then you will fly as a well as any owl.”</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">Gilda was right, so right!</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“My goodness,” Mum gasped as I landed on the branch.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I’ve never seen anything like it!” my father said, his voice tinged with awe. “You flew as if every single one of your plummels had budged and they haven’t yet, have they? They’re always the last to come.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“No, I don’t think they have,” I replied.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Then how did you do it? You were so quiet,” Mum asked.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Oh, I just imagined the plummels.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Imagined?” Both my parents said the word at once, as if they had never heard it before.</p>
<p class="centerImage"><img alt="image" class="epubimage" src="images/sbni.jpg"/></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%;">Moss’s hollow was at least twice as large as ours. This was to be expected, I suppose, seeing as Snowies are more than twice the size of Whiskered Screeches. From their heads to their tails, they measure the length of three Screeches, end to end. But the thing I remember best is how wilfed Moss was. He was all scrunched up at his mum’s legs like a chick trying to get warm under her belly feathers. This was Moss? The gifted, talented Moss? I was astounded. But I had forgotten how I had seen him wilf the day his mum first arrived. Now he seemed not just puny, but frightened and scared. Yes, frightened! The mighty Moss, who just a few nights before had returned from his triumphant circumnavigation of the Hock! What was wrong with him? He seemed to be cowering, and every time his mum moved, so did he. It was as if he couldn’t be an inch from her. Was Moss a mama’s owlet?</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The visit started out with the requisite small talk. Profuse thanks for the two voles my parents had brought, more talk about Moss’s amazing circumnavigation, but then as always, the conversation turned to the war.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, Hrenna had a time of it up around Little Hoole.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“They have a few small stealth units wreaking havoc up there. They hide out in the fissures.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Snow leopard terrain,” my father said. I was immediately alert. Snow leopards had fascinated me, and Gilda had once told me a twixt-time story about them. They could not be found as far south as Stormfast and lived in the high mountain ranges above the H’rathghar glacier. Fierce, with fangs nearly as long and sharp as ice scimitars, and exceedingly swift, they were, my father said, “Built to kill.” There was a pause in the conversation as Hrenna and Arne, her mate, exchanged glances. Arne gave her a barely perceptible nod, and I noticed Moss begin to quiver.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Yes, built to kill,” Arne said.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Then Hrenna spoke in a rasping whisper. “And so am I!” She lifted her port leg. The foot was blackened and the four talons fused together into one mangled lump. I must have looked shocked, for she turned to me and then to Moss. “Don’t fret,” she said cheerfully. “You’re never really tested until you’re in the field of battle, and you young’uns will both make wonderful soldiers. I know it! Don’t you, Rask? Don’t you, Ulfa?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">I had to fight hard now not to wilf in front of everyone’s eyes. I noticed that Moss didn’t look too chipper, either, which made me feel a tad better.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“It wasn’t the snow leopards that got me, though. It was two Eagle Owls. They thought they had me when they came at me with a fizblister….”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">The grown-ups kept talking, but Moss was wilfing so fiercely I thought he might simply vanish. Now I understood. He was overwhelmed with shame! Yes, shame at the hideous deformity of his mum’s talons and how they looked as if they had melted in the fires of hagsmire. The grown-ups were consumed with talk of war and not paying a bit of attention to us.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“This foot has become a weapon in its own right. I swear it’s as powerful as one of those gigantic snow leopard paws. The force I can deliver with it is amazing. After I healed and was battle ready again, I managed to crack one of the enemy Eagle Owl’s starboard wings nearly in two in an ambush half a moon later.” She raised the foot with the fused, blackened talons. It looked like a club.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“An Eagle Owl!” I heard my parents exclaim. An Eagle Owl had a wingspan at least half again as big as a Snowy’s.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">She chuckled a bit. “Now I lead a commando unit called the Flying Leopards. Did it with this! It’s better than an ice ax. One might say this wound has made me ‘built to kill.’” Hrenna shook the mangled talon.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Moss had clamped his eyes shut. It was clear that he was a bundle of fear and shame. I lofted myself into the dim light of the hollow and flew toward my mum.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“What is it?” she asked. I gave a small tug on her bandanna. “Oh, my, you want me to show off my battle scar, do you?” She chuckled, obviously pleased. “It’s not a competition, you know, dear. Hrenna and I both did our bit. That’s all a soldier can do.” No, it wasn’t a competition, but how could I explain that to Mum? I just wanted Moss to see that I knew what he had been feeling.</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">Moss sidled up to me and whispered, “I saw you arrive tonight. It was a beautiful landing. Better than any I’ve ever made. How soon do you think you might be ready for Dark Fowl?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“I’m not sure. Why?”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">“Because I’d like to fly there with you. It would be much more fun if we could go together.”</p>
<p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%;">So it was on that night, in the hollow of the Snowies while our mums and das spoke of war and bloody battles, that Moss and I became best friends.</p>
